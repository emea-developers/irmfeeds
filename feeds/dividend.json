          "maintext": "<p><b>The Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc (“RDS”) today announced an interim dividend in respect of the third quarter of 2013 of US$0.45 per A ordinary share (“A Share”) and B ordinary share (“B Share”), an increase of US$ 0.02 on the equivalent US dollar dividend for the same quarter last year.</b></p> \n<p>RDS provides eligible shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme (“the Programme”).&nbsp; For further details please see below.</p><h2>Details relating to the third quarter 2013 interim dividend</h2><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group.</p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ordinary share</th> \n   <th>Q3 2013</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.45</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.45</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p> \n<p>Cash dividends on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p> \n<p>The pounds sterling and euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on December 6, 2013.</p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ADS</th> \n   <th>Q3 2013</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.90</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.90</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) will be paid, by default, in US dollars.</p> \n<p>ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h2>Scrip Dividend Programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.&nbsp; Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on www.shell.com/scrip.</p><h2>Dividend timetable for the third quarter 2013 interim dividend</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>&nbsp;</th> \n   <th><p>3rd quarter 2013</p> </th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Announcement date</th> \n   <td>October 31, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Ex-dividend date</th> \n   <td>November 13, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Record date&nbsp;</th> \n   <td>November 15, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th> \n   <td>November 20, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><i><b>(*)</b></i></sup></th> \n   <td>November 29, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</th> \n   <td>December 6, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Payment date</th> \n   <td>December 23, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom and their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.</p> \n<p>The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the third quarter 2013 interim dividend of US$0.45 is US$0.05 per ordinary share and the dividend and tax credit together amount to US$0.50. The pounds sterling and euro equivalents will be announced on December 6, 2013.<br /> </p> \n<p><b>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br /> The Hague, October 31st, 2013</b></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Contacts</h2><p><b>Investor Relations&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>International: &nbsp;+ 31 70 377 4540<br /> USA: +1 713 241 1042</p> \n<p><b><br /> Media<br /> </b>International&nbsp; +44 207 934 5550<br /> USA&nbsp; +1 713 241 4544<br /> </p> \n<p><br /> <br /> <b>Cautionary note<br /> </b>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.
