For further details please see below.</p><h3>Details relating to the third quarter 2012 interim dividend</h3><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th>Per ordinary share</th><th>Q3 2012</th></tr><tr><td>RDS A shares (US$)</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>RDS B shares (US$)</td><td>0.43</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p><p>Cash dividends on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p><p>The pounds sterling & euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on December 7, 2012.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th>Per ADS</th><th>Q3 2012</th></tr><tr><td>RDS A ADSs (US$)</td><td>0.86</td></tr><tr><td>RDS B ADSs (US$)</td><td>0.86</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Cash dividends on American Depository Shares (\"ADSs\") will be paid, by default, in US dollars.</p><p>ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR & ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h3>Scrip Dividend Programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p><p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends, if approved by the Board. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p><p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p><p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p><p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.</p><p>Shareholders who held only B Shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p><p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h3>Dividend timetable for the third quarter 2012 interim dividend</h3><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th><p>3rd quarter 2012</p></th></tr><tr><th>Announcement date</th><td>November 1, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Ex-dividend date</th><td>November 14, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Record date </th><td>November 16, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th><td>November 21, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Closing of scrip election & currency election <sup><em><strong>(*)</strong></em></sup></th><td>November 30, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Pounds sterling & euro equivalents announcement date</th><td>December 7, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Payment date</th><td>December 20, 2012</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><em>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered & non registered ADS holders. <br/>Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom & their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.</p><p>The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the third quarter 2012 interim dividend of US$0.43 is US$0.05 per ordinary share & the dividend & tax credit together amount to US$0.48.

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.</p><h3>Reference ADS Price</h3><p>ADS stands for \"American Depositary Share\". ADR stands for \"American Depositary Receipt\". An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR & ADS are often used interchangeably).  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q2 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Reference ADS price (US$)</td><td>70.850</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.  A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary.  Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.  The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs & B ADSs.<br/><br/>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.  Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website: <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.</p><h3>Scrip dividend programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br/><br/>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.|<br/><br/>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br/><br/>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br/><br/>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br/><br/>Shareholders who held only B shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br/><br/>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

Shell is a leading operator in the UK sector of the North Sea & intends to maintain this position. Offshore, Shell has interests in more than 50 fields, operates more than 30 platform installations, 30 subsea installations & one production (FPSO) vessel. Onshore, we operate three gas plants; the St. Fergus Gas Terminal & Fife NGL Plant (with Braefoot Bay marine terminal) in Scotl&, & Bacton in the east of England. Shell operates a significant number of its interests in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) on behalf of a 50:50 joint venture with ExxonMobil. The Shell share of UK oil & gas production is about 8% (140 kboe/d in 2011). Almost half of this is gas. This is almost 4% of total Shell Group production.</p><p>2. Shell & Hess Corporation signed an agreement on May 29, 2012 to acquire Hess\u2019s 15.67% interest in the BP operated Schiehallion field.

		"title": "Major construction begins on the Prelude FLNG project - the world's biggest offshore floating facility",
		"maintext": "<p>Shell\u2019s Projects &amp; Technology Director Matthias Bichsel commented:  \"We are cutting 7.6 tonnes of steel for the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility today, but in total, more than 260,000 tonnes of steel will be fabricated & assembled for the facility.  That\u2019s around five times the amount of steel used to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Today\u2019s ceremony marks a major milestone in this project, when the innovative thinking & new technology & engineering solutions which will make FLNG possible begin to be realised.\"  </p><p>When completed, the Prelude FLNG facility will be 488 metres long & 74 metres wide, making it the largest offshore floating facility ever built.  When fully equipped & with its cargo tanks full, it will weigh more than 600,000 tonnes.  There will be over 3,000 kilometres of electrical & instrumentation cables on the FLNG facility, the distance from Barcelona to Moscow.</p><p>\"Making FLNG a reality is no simple feat,\" Matthias continued.  \"Shell is uniquely positioned to make it a success given our commercial capability; our LNG, offshore, deepwater & marine technology; & our proven ability to successfully deliver megaprojects.\" </p><p>In order to meet the world\u2019s growing energy demand, bringing new supplies to market is critical. The Prelude FLNG facility will be deployed in Australian waters over 200 kilometres from the nearest point on the coast.  It will produce gas at sea, turn it into liquefied natural gas & then transfer it directly to the ships that will transport it to customers. </p><p>An expert team from Shell will manage the multi-year construction of the FLNG facility to ensure the Prelude project\u2019s critical dimensions of safety, quality, cost & schedule are delivered.  Strategic partners Technip & Samsung Heavy Industries (the Technip Samsung Consortium) along with SBM & hundreds of suppliers & contractors around the world are all contributing valuable knowledge, skills & equipment to help make the project a success.  At peak levels, around 5,000 people will be working on the construction of the FLNG facility in South Korea; & another 1,000 will build the turret mooring system, subsea & wells equipment in other locations across the globe.</p><p>In the lead up to the facility being ready to start production, a number of actions will take place, such as drilling the production wells, installation of subsea flowlines & risers & mooring chains to prepare for the arrival of the FLNG facility.</p><p>Prelude FLNG is the latest in a line of Shell achievements in developing new technologies for the oil & gas industry, reinforcing its leadership in technology & innovation.  This is the first of what Shell expects to be multiple Shell FLNG projects.</p><h3>Notes to editors</h3><p>In 2012, Australian subsidiaries of INPEX Corporation (17.5%) & Korea Gas Corporation (10%) joined the Prelude FLNG project.  An Australian subsidiary of CPC Corporation (5%) has also signed an agreement to do so.  Completion of this transaction remains subject to conditions including Taiwanese government approval. By taking a stake in the project, INPEX, KOGAS & CPC show the confidence they place in Shell\u2019s FLNG technology.</p><p>FLNG will enable the development of gas resources ranging from clusters of smaller more remote fields to potentially larger fields via multiple facilities where, for a range of reasons, an onshore development is not viable. This can mean faster, cheaper, more flexible development & deployment strategies for resources that were previously uneconomic, or constrained by technical or other risks.</p><p>Many of the technologies used on the FLNG facility are ones that Shell has used successfully onshore, but some have been extended or modified for offshore.  The new technologies that Shell developed for FLNG include:  managing sloshing in LNG tanks; systems for managing the close coupling between the producing wells & the LNG processing facility; LNG offloading arms; water intake risers;  mooring systems; & the marinisation of processing equipment such as absorption columns & the main cryogenic heat exchangers.  All of these technologies have been extensively modelled & tested to ensure they can operate safely & efficiently under marine conditions.</p><p>Shell\u2019s innovation in FLNG has been recognised by the industry including:</p><ul><li>Lloyd\u2019s List award for Technological Innovation 2012 </li><li>CWC / WGI LNG Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Industry 2011</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://shell.qbank.se/v2.7/mb.php?h=b8bb32c8c976a2b5f4b3450cf4d1a2d4\">Download images from the steel cutting</a></li></ul><h3>Enquiries</h3><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong></p><p>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550<br/>Australia: +61 417 007 344</p><p><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br/></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br/>United States \u2013 Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong>Cautionary note</strong></p><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly & indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

		"maintext": "<p>Over the last several days, Shell has successfully completed a series of tests of the first-ever Arctic Containment System. However, during a final test, the containment dome aboard the Arctic Challenger barge was damaged. It is clear that some days will be required to repair & fully assess dome readiness. We are disappointed that the dome has not yet met our stringent acceptance standards; but, as we have said all along, we will not conduct any operation until we are satisfied that we are fully prepared to do it safely. <br/><br/>The time required to repair the dome, along with steps we have taken to protect local whaling operations & to ensure the safety of operations from ice floe movement, have led us to revise our plans for the 2012-2013 exploration program. In order to lay a strong foundation for operations in 2013, we will forgo drilling into hydrocarbon zones this year. Instead, we will begin as many wells, known as â\u20AC˜top holes,\u2019 as time remaining in this season allows. The top portion of the wells drilled in the days & weeks ahead will be safely capped & temporarily ab&oned this year, in accordance with regulatory requirements. We look forward to the final receipt of our drilling permits for the multi-year exploration program upon the successful testing & deployment of the Arctic Containment System.<br/><br/>These capabilities have, most recently, been evident in Shell\u2019s ice management operations as it successfully moved one of its drill ships & support vessels safely out of the path of approaching sea ice. That drill ship, the Noble Discoverer, is expected to resume its position & drilling operations over the â\u20AC˜Burger A\u2019 prospect in the days ahead. <br/><br/>Also, in the coming days, Shell is expected to begin exploratory drilling in the Beaufort Sea. These operations will follow the conclusion of the fall whale hunt & the anticipated receipt of a top hole drilling permit. <br/><br/>We have tested & assembled drill ships & support vessels, trained personnel, & acquired numerous final approved plans & permits. This exploration program remains critically important to America\u2019s energy needs, to the economy & jobs in Alaska, & to Shell.</p><h3>Enquiries </h3><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong><br/>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550 <br/><br/><strong>Shell Investor Relations</strong><br/>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br/>United States - Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong><br/>Cautionary note </strong><br/>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly & indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

Our profits have fallen with energy prices, but our growth strategy is delivering to the bottom line.</p><p>Shell's second quarter 2012 earnings declined from year-ago levels, with weaker oil & North American gas prices offsetting the benefit of increased upstream volumes & improved refining margins. Our profits pay for Shell's dividends & substantial investments in new projects, to ensure affordable & reliable energy supplies for our customers, adding value for our shareholders.\"</p><p>Voser continued: \"Our industry continues to see significant energy price volatility as a result of economic & political developments. Shell is implementing a long-term, consistent strategy against this volatile backdrop.

For further details please see below.</p><h3>Details relating to the second quarter 2012 interim dividend</h3><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th>Per ordinary share</th><th>Q2 2012</th></tr><tr><td>RDS A shares (US$)</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>RDS B shares (US$)</td><td>0.43</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Dividends declared on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p><p>Dividends declared on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p><p>The pounds sterling & euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on September 3, 2012.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th>Per ADS</th><th>Q2 2012</th></tr><tr><td>RDS A ADSs (US$)</td><td>0.86</td></tr><tr><td>RDS B ADSs (US$)</td><td>0.86</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Dividends declared on American Depository Shares (\"ADSs\") will be paid, by default, in US dollars.</p><p>ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs.  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of  RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B.  In many cases the terms ADR & ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h3>Scrip Dividend Programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p><p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.

		"maintext": "p>The two offshore oil & gas PSCs with CNOOC are for blocks 62/02 & 62/17 in the Yinggehai Basin. Shell, as operator, will apply advanced seismic acquisition & processing technologies to conduct 3D seismic data surveys in the Yinggehai blocks. Shell will cover the costs for  the acquisition of seismic data & will use advanced drilling technologies to drill exploration wells during the exploration phase. Shell will hold a 100% working interest during the exploration phase, that will be reduced to 49% in any eventual development phase, with CNOOC as majority partner.</p><p>The onshore tight gas PSC amendment with CNPC represents a new phase for the development of the existing Changbei block with 1,692.5 square kilometers in the Ordos Basin, & adds scope to develop additional tight gas sands & further develop the already producing main reservoir. Subject to government approval & pending the outcome of the appraisal campaign, this additional development project could increase the current production plateau of 320mmscf/d. Shell will continue to be the operator at Changbei.</p><p>In Gabon, CNOOC will acquire a 25% participating interest in offshore exploration blocks BC9 & BCD10. CNOOC will reimburse Shell for 25% of certain past exploration costs & carry part of the future exploration costs. Shell will remain operator with 75% interest. The agreement is subject to government approval. Lim Haw-Kuang, Executive Chairman of Shell Companies in China, said: \"We are delighted about the return to offshore exploration in China & the opportunity to work with CNOOC again on a major project in the country. We are equally delighted to continue & expand the Changbei success story in partnership with CNPC. Moreover, we are very pleased to have entered the farm-out agreement with CNOOC in Gabon.

		"title": "Shell signs share purchase agreement to acquire Gasnor",
		"maintext": "<p>Gasnor is a market leader in Norway in small scale LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), supplying LNG as a fuel to industrial & marine customers & operating an end to end supply chain, with three small scale production plants & distribution assets including two tanker ships, a fleet of trucks & a network of terminals. The acquisition of Gasnor is an important step for Shell towards creating an LNG sales business.  LNG will be a reliable new addition to Shell's commercial customers' fuel mix.</p><p>Colin Abraham, Shell's Vice President for Downstream LNG, said: \"The benefits of natural gas in meeting our future energy needs are well-documented. Shell believes the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in transport sector will develop into a sizeable market & given its industry leading expertise across the LNG value chain, the extension into this market is a good fit for Shell. The Gasnor acquisition provides Shell with invaluable customer & market insight built up over a number of years. This will help us to quickly develop & meet customer requirements for LNG as a transport fuel.\"</p><p>Through this acquisition, Shell will capitalise on Gasnor's experience in LNG sales & marketing, combining it with its own customer reach to target European marine customers ahead of new environmental regulations that will come into force from 2015.  These regulations will apply across the Baltic Sea, English Channel & North Sea & will require lower levels of Ã¢€Ëœair-quality emissions' such as sulphur oxides (SOx) & nitrogen oxides (NOx). Switching to LNG can help to reduce these emissions.  Shell expects European marine LNG to be a key growth sector as customers look for cleaner, cost competitive fuel alternatives as part of their fuel supply mix.</p><p>Eilef Stange, Gasnor's Chief Executive Officer, said: \"Shell's customer reach & Gasnor's LNG sales & marketing experience is a winning combination.  There is real growth potential for small scale LNG in Europe, particularly in the marine sector, & Gasnor with Shell is well placed to capitalise on this.\"</p><p>LNG as a marine fuel is not new. LNG has been used to power gas engines in LNG carriers for many years. Shell has been a pioneer in this area, & has an excellent track record in terms of the safe storage, h&ling & movement of LNG.</p><p>In September 2011 Shell took its first final investment decision on a LNG for transport project in Canada to supply LNG to Shell Flying J truck stops for use by heavy truck fleets. In June 2012, Shell signed a memor&um of understanding with TravelCenters of America LLC (TA) to sell LNG to heavy-duty road transport customers in the US through TA's existing nationwide network of full-service fueling centers.</p><h3>Note to editors</h3><ul><li>Shell is a global leader in upstream LNG & helped pioneer the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, providing the technology for the world's first commercial liquefaction plant in 1964. Shell is a participant in nine operating LNG projects with some 21.5 million tonnes per annum operational LNG capacity, in seven countries. It has three new projects under construction with 15 mtpa of LNG options. Shell was a partner in the first-ever purpose built LNG carrier & has been delivering LNG safely for nearly half a century.

		"maintext": "<h3>Reference Share Price</h3><p>The Reference Share price is used for calculating a Participating Shareholder's entitlement under the Scrip Dividend Programme, as defined below.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q1 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Reference share price (US$)</td><td>32.785</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The Reference Share Price is the US dollar equivalent of the average of the closing price for the Company's A Shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam for the five dealing days commencing on (& including) the date on which the Shares are first quoted ex-dividend in respect of the relevant dividend.<br/><br/>The Reference Share Price is calculated by reference to the Euronext Amsterdam closing price in euro. The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.</p><h3>Reference ADS Price</h3><p>ADS stands for \"American Depositary Share\". ADR stands for \"American Depositary Receipt\". An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR & ADS are often used interchangeably).  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q1 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Reference ADS price (US$)</td><td>65.570</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.  A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary. Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price. The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs & B ADSs.<br/><br/>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.  Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website:  <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.</p><h3>Scrip dividend programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br/><br/>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.  Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br/><br/>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br/><br/>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br/><br/>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br/><br/>Shareholders who held only B shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br/><br/>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br/>The Hague, May 16,2012</strong></p>",

ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An Â ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. Â ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B. Â Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of Â RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. Â In many cases the terms ADR & ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h3>Scrip Dividend Programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p><p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Â Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p><p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p><p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p><p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p><p>Shareholders who held only B Shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p><p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h3>Dividend timetable for the first quarter 2012 interim dividend</h3><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th><p>1st quarter 2012</p></th></tr><tr><th>Announcement date</th><td>April 26, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Ex-dividend date</th><td>May 9, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Record date </th><td>May 11, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th><td>May 16, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Closing of scrip election & currency election <sup><em>(*)</em></sup></th><td>May 25, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Pounds sterling & euro equivalents announcement date</th><td>June 1, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Payment date</th><td>June 21, 2012</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><em>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered & non registered ADS holders.<br/>Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit.

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.</p><h3>Reference ADS Price</h3><p>ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs.  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of  RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.  In many cases the terms ADR & ADS are used interchangeably.</p><p>The A Reference ADS Price will apply to holders of A ADSs who are subject to Dutch withholding tax. The Alternative Reference ADS Price will apply to holders of A ADSs who are not subject to Dutch withholding tax & all holders of B ADSs.</p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q4 2011</th></tr><tr><td>A reference ADS price (US$)</td><td>73.911</td></tr><tr><td>Alternative reference ADS price (US$)</td><td>73.719</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Reference ADS Price equals (i) the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS plus (ii) the UK stamp duty reserve tax (\"SDRT\"), which is chargeable at 1.5 per cent. with respect to each new A ADS. The A Reference ADS Price will also include an amount equal to the Dutch withholding tax rate of 15 per cent. on the SDRT. The Alternative Reference ADS Price will not be adjusted to reflect Dutch withholding tax.</p><h3>Scrip dividend programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p><p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.  Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p><p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p><p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p><p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p><p>Shareholders who held only B shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.</p><p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br/>The Hague, February 22, 2012<br/></strong></p>",

		"title": "Royal Dutch Shell sets out new growth agenda",
		"maintext": "<p><strong>Key highlights:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Global economy & energy markets likely to see continued high volatility. Shell remains focused on through-cycle investment for sustainable growth. </strong></li><li><strong>Delivery of underlying strategic drivers for 2012 targets established, underpinned by 14 project start-ups 2009-11, & Shell's continuous improvement programmes.</strong></li><li><strong>Shell declared ~$10.5 billion of dividends in 2011 & expects to grow the dividend in 2012, reflecting an improving financial position. </strong></li><li><strong>Net capital investment  in 2012 of $30 billion - 80% in Upstream - as Shell invests for a new tranche of growth.</strong></li><li><strong>Measured increase in spending & payout underpinned by a new outlook for cashflow from operations for the period 2012-15 some 30-50% higher than the 2008-11  total. </strong></li><li><strong>Growth outlook driven by over 60 new projects & options, maturing ~20 billion boe of new resources potential, including major projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), deep water, tight gas, liquids-rich shales & traditional plays.<br/></strong></li></ul><p>Economic development in non-OECD countries is driving sustained & long term demand growth for all forms of energy. Regulatory & political uncertainties, combined with challenges in debt markets, are adding to price & cost volatility in this long term trend. Shell is investing for sustainable growth through what is likely to remain a highly volatile period in the economy & energy markets. The company's activities provide affordable, safe & reliable energy supplies for our customers, world-wide.</p><h3>Delivering on targets to 2012</h3><p>Shell's three-year strategic plan, first outlined in early 2010, was designed to build the foundations for profitable growth for shareholders, by improving near-term competitive performance, & delivering growth to 2012. The main strategic drivers of this plan have now been achieved:</p><ul><li>Performance focus.  A substantial corporate reorganization, launched in 2009, simplified the company, reduced costs, & created a platform for faster delivery of our strategy. In addition, we are driving the Downstream portfolio to improve returns & growth potential. </li><li>Cashflow from operations excluding working capital movements was $43 billion in 2011 - reaching the headline target we had set for 2012 - rebalancing the company to surplus cashflow. </li><li>Continuous improvement & capital efficiency are embedded in Shell. Disposals of $17 billion from 2009-11, & $15 billion of acquisitions are repositioning the company for new growth. </li><li>Growth delivery. Shell has started up 14 new projects in 2009-11 - including the world class Pearl gas-to-liquids project in Qatar. </li><li>Shell's oil & gas resources base on stream has increased by 33%, or 3 billion boe, to 12 billion boe between 2009 & 2011. Maintaining a strong project flow, the company is maturing a further 20 billion boe of new resources for future growth.  </li></ul><p>Our headline proved Reserves Replacement Ratio for the year on an SEC basis is expected to be around 100%. Our Organic Reserves Replacement Ratio, which excludes the impact of oil price movements in the year, acquisitions & divestments, is expected to be around 120%.</p><p>Shell's CEO Peter Voser commented: \"Shell's strategy is innovative & competitive. Our improving financial position creates an opportunity to increase both our dividends & investment levels. With ramp up now well in h& for near-term growth, I want to move our agenda forward today, with new targets for the company.\"</p><p>\"We are delivering our growth plans. Today's update sets a new & sustainable growth agenda for the company. We declared over $10 billion of dividends in 2011 & we are expecting to return to dividend growth for 2012. This reflects our confidence that there is more to come from Shell. \" </p><h3>Setting out new priorities </h3><p>Voser commented: \"We have worked hard to generate a strong pipeline of investment opportunities for Shell, & we put the emphasis firmly on a competitive financial performance. Shell's investment programmes create cashflow growth, which in turn funds our dividends. All of this is supported by efficiency gains from our continuous improvement programmes, where the opportunity set runs to billions of dollars for Shell.\"</p><ul><li>Net capital investment will be some $30 billion in 2012, with over ~80% Upstream, of which 60% will be in North America & Australia. We continue to mature further development opportunities, with Final Investment Decision on 17 new projects in 2010-11. In 2011, the company has built new positions including Iraq gas, Asia Pacific LNG, liquids-rich shales, & new exploration acreage in 10 countries.  This portfolio growth supports our increased investment program & updated growth outlook.</li><li>Our cashflow from operations for 2008-11 was $136 billion, excluding working capital movements. Cashflow from operations should be some 30-50% higher for  2012-15 <sup><em>(A)</em></sup> .</li><li>Capital efficiency is a key part of Shell's strategy. Divestments are expected to be $2-3 billion in 2012, with $17 billion of asset sales completed in 2009-11. </li><li>In Upstream, the company expects some 250,000 boe/d of asset sales & licence expiries over the 2012-17 timeframe. Assuming these impacts play out, oil &amp; gas production should average some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18, an increase of some 25% from 2011 levels of 3.2 million boe/d.</li></ul><p><sup><em>(A) Outlook assumes  $80-100 Brent, improved North America gas & Downstream environment from 2011, & excludes working capital movments.</em></sup></p><h3>Growth investment</h3><p>The key investment themes that underpin this profitable growth include over 60 new projects & options, which should unlock oil &amp; gas resources potential of over 20 billion boe.</p><ul><li>Exploration. We continue to balance exploration drilling in established basins, with selective expansion into frontier acreage, & new plays such as liquids-rich shales. Our exploration spending increased by some 30% to $3.6 billion in 2011, excluding acreage purchases, & should increase a further 35% in 2012 to some $5 billion. </li><li>Traditional developments in Shell's heartl&s will see $6 billion of 2012 investment. This includes extending the life of Shell's mature heartl& positions such as the UK North Sea & South East Asia. Around $3 billion of investment in this category will be in countries with large undeveloped resources positions - Nigeria, Kazakhstan & Iraq.   </li><li>Integrated gas. Shell has ~8 mtpa of LNG capacity under construction - all in Australia - an increase of ~40% over today's position, with at least $5 billion of capital investment planned for 2012. In addition, Shell has some 15 mtpa of new LNG capacity under study.</li><li>Deep water oil & gas spending in 2012 of some $4 billion, with 250,000 boe/d under construction, in 7 projects spanning the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil & Malaysia.  </li><li>Tight gas & liquids-rich shales. Shell continues to build a world-wide portfolio in these new plays, with 50,000 square kilometers in total, including an increase of 12,000 square kilometers in 2011 in liquids-rich plays. We allocate capital to these plays on a short term basis with a high degree of flexibility, driven by economics & affordability. Some $4 billion of world-wide development investment is planned for 2012, focusing on production from the lowest cost gas positions, & growing our liquids production. Production from liquids-rich shales has the potential to reach some 250,000 boe/d in 2017. </li><li>In heavy oil world-wide, we are planning for $2 billion of 2012 spending, covering EOR, mining & upgrading activities. In Canada, Shell is investing in a series of debottlenecking projects in oil sands mining, which will add ~50,000 b/d by 2020. We expect to take final investment decision on a 1.1 mtpa carbon capture & storage project - Quest - in 2012.</li><li>We continue to focus on operational excellence & selective growth in Downstream, with $6 billion investment planned for 2012. Commissioning is underway at the 325,000 b/d Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States, at some 600,000 b/d. Shell is also looking at new manufacturing capacity options in North America, in Qatar & in China, as well as selective growth in marketing activities, & continued momentum in Brazil biofuels.</li></ul><h3>Enquiries</h3><p><strong>Shell Media Relations<br/></strong>International, UK, European Press: +31 70 377 3600<br/> <br/><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br/></strong>Europe: + 31 70 377 3996  <br/>United States: +1 713 241 2069</p><h3>Definitions & cautionary statement</h3><p>resources:  Our use of the term \"resources\" in this press release includes quantities of oil & gas not yet classified as SEC proved oil & gas reserves or SEC proven mining reserves.  resources are consistent with the Society of Petroleum Engineers 2P & 2C definitions.</p><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly & indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

		"maintext": "<p>The Board expects that the first quarter 2012 interim dividend will be US$0.43, an increase of 2% over the US dollar dividend for the same quarter in the previous year. The first quarter 2012 interim dividend is scheduled to be announced on April 26, 2012.</p><p>RDS provides eligible shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme (\"the Programme\").  For further details please see below.</p><h3>Details relating to the fourth quarter 2011 interim dividend</h3><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th>Per ordinary share</th><th>Q4 2011</th></tr><tr><td>RDS A shares (US$)</td><td>0.42</td></tr><tr><td>RDS B shares (US$)</td><td>0.42</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Dividends declared on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p><p>Dividends declared on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p><p>The pounds sterling & euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on March 9, 2012.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th>Per ADS</th><th>Q4 2011</th></tr><tr><td>RDS A ADSs (US$)</td><td>0.84</td></tr><tr><td>RDS B ADSs (US$)</td><td>0.84</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Dividends declared on American Depository Shares (\"ADSs\") will be paid, by default, in US dollars.</p><p>ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR & ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h3>Scrip Dividend Programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p><p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.  Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p><p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p><p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p><p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p><p>Shareholders who held only B Shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p><p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h3>Dividend timetable for the fourth quarter 2011 interim dividend</h3><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>4th quarter 2011</th></tr><tr><th>Announcement date</th><td>Feb 2, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Ex-dividend date</th><td>Feb 15, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Record date </th><td>Feb 17, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th><td>Feb 22, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Closing of scrip election & currency election <sup><em>(*)</em></sup></th><td>Mar 2, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Pounds sterling & euro equivalents announcement date</th><td>Mar 9, 2012</td></tr><tr><th>Payment date</th><td>Mar 22, 2012</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><em>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered & non registered ADS holders.<br/>Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Please contact your broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial institution where you hold your securities account for the election deadline that applies</em><em>.</em></p><h3>Taxation cash dividends</h3><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be subject to the deduction of Netherl&s dividend withholding tax at the rate of 15%, which may be reduced in certain circumstances. Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom & their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.</p><p>The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the fourth quarter 2011 interim dividend of US$0.42 is US$0.05 per ordinary share & the dividend & tax credit together amount to US$0.47. The pounds sterling & euro equivalents will be announced on March 9, 2012.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br/>The Hague, February 2nd, 2012</strong></p><p><strong><br/><br/></strong></p><h3>Contacts</h3><p><strong>Investor Relations  <br/></strong>Europe:  + 31 70 377 4540<br/>USA: +1 713 241 1042</p><p><strong><br/>Media<br/></strong>Europe:  + 31 70 377 3600</p><p><br/><br/><strong>Cautionary note<br/></strong>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly & indirectly owns investments are separate entities.
