Second quarter 2013 earnings included an identified net charge of $2.2 billion after tax, mainly reflecting impairments (see page 6).<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Second quarter 2013 CCS earnings excluding identified items (see page 6), were $4.6 billion and included a combined negative impact of $0.7 billion after tax related to the impact of the weakening Australian dollar on a deferred tax liability and the impact of the deteriorating operating environment in Nigeria. Compared to the second quarter 2012, CCS earnings excluding identified items were also impacted by higher operating expenses and depreciation as well as increased exploration well write-offs. Second quarter 2012 CCS earnings excluding identified items were $5.7 billion.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Basic CCS earnings per share excluding identified items decreased by 21% versus the same quarter a year ago.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter 2013 was $12.4 billion, compared with $13.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Excluding working capital movements, cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter 2013 was $8.4 billion, compared with $9.5 billion in the second quarter 2012.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Capital investment for the second quarter 2013 was $11.3 billion. Net capital investment (see Note 1) for the quarter was $10.9 billion.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Total dividends distributed in the quarter were $2.8 billion, of which some $0.8 billion were settled under the Scrip Dividend Programme. During the second quarter some 56.2 million shares were bought back for cancellation for a consideration of $1.9 billion.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Gearing at the end of the second quarter 2013 was 10.3% (see Note 2).<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>A second quarter 2013 dividend has been announced of $0.45 per ordinary share and $0.90 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”), an increase of 5% compared with the second quarter 2012.<br /> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Summary of unaudited results</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>Quarters</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>$ million</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>Half year</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>Q2 2013</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>Q1 2013</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Q2 2012<b><sup>1</sup></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>%<sup>2</sup></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>2013</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>2012<b><sup>1</sup></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>%</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>1,737</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>8,176</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4,083</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>57</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>Income attributable to shareholders</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>9,913</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>12,820</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>23</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>657</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>(225)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>1,901</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>Current cost of supplies (CCS) adjustment for Downstream</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>432</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>841</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>2,394</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>7,951</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5,984</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>60</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>CCS earnings </b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>10,345</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>13,661</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>24</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>(2,206)</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>431</p> </td> \n   <td><p>245</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>Less: Identified items<sup>3</sup></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>(1,775)</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>625</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>4,600</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>7,520</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5,739</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>20</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>CCS earnings excluding identified items</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>12,120</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>13,036</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>7</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Of which:</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>3,526</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>5,648</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4,527</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These results were undermined by a number of factors – but they were clearly disappointing for Shell“, continued Voser.</p> \n<p>Oil theft and disruptions to gas supplies in Nigeria are causing widespread environmental damage, and could cost the Nigerian government $12 billion in lost revenues per year. “We will play our part, but these are problems Shell cannot solve alone,” Voser said.</p> \n<p>“We’ve made substantial improvements to our portfolio in the last few years. Today, Shell is rich with new investment opportunities and is capital constrained – the opposite position to where the company was in the middle of the last decade.”</p> \n<p>“Shell is investing in new capacity worldwide, to generate profitable growth for shareholders. In the next 18 months we expect to see five major project start-ups, which should add over $4 billion to our 2015 cash flow<i><sup>(1)</sup></i>.</p> \n<p>We’ve embedded rigorous portfolio management into Shell, to improve our capital efficiency and refresh the portfolio for growth. We have completed some $21 billion of divestments in the last three years and some $4 billion in the last 12 months alone, with more to come.</p> \n<p>Shell is entering a new phase of more substantial portfolio change, which will lead to a higher rate of divestments in the coming years.</p> \n<p>We have recently launched strategic portfolio reviews in both Nigeria onshore and North America resources plays, which will lead to further focus and divestments there, as we continue to shape the company for the future.</p> \n<p>Our strategy is to deliver sustainable growth in cash generation through the business cycle, underpinning Shell’s competitive dividends and returns. We are not targeting oil and gas production volumes; rather we are focusing on financial performance.”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded, “Shell’s sustained investment in new growth projects will drive our financial performance. Dividends are Shell’s main route for returning cash to shareholders and we have distributed more than $11 billion of dividends in the last 12 months. So far this year, we have repurchased more than $3 billion of shares, and we are on track for $4-5 billion of share buy-backs in 2013. This underlines our commitment to shareholder returns.”</p> \n<p><i><sup><br /> (1) </sup>Projects comprised of Mars B and Cardamom in deep-water Gulf of Mexico, Gumusut-Kakap in deep-water Malaysia, Kashagan Phase 1 in Kazakhstan and the completion of the acquisition of part of Repsol S.A.’s LNG portfolio.

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on www.shell.com/scrip.<br /> </p><h2>Dividend timetable for the second quarter 2013 interim dividend</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>2nd quarter 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Announcement date</td> \n   <td>August 1, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ex-divident date</td> \n   <td>August 14, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Record date</td> \n   <td>August 16, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Scrip reference share price announcement date</td> \n   <td>August 21, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Closing of scrip election and currency election (*)</td> \n   <td>September 2, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</td> \n   <td>September 9, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Payment date</td> \n   <td>September 26, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i><br /> * A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

      "maintext": "<p>&quot;Offshore Brazil is a key part of our plans to grow our deepwater portfolio – a key component of our global strategy,” said John Hollowell, Executive Vice President for Deep Water, Shell Upstream Americas. “We look forward to continuing the work with our partners in offshore Brazil to develop the resources in a safe and responsible way.”</p> \n<p>For Parque das Conchas (BC-10), Shell and its partners Petrobras and ONGC, have decided to move forward with Phase 3 of the project, which will include the installation of subsea-infrastructure at the Massa and Argonauta O-South fields. These fields will be tied-back to the Esp&iacute;rito Santo – the floating, production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) – that is at the center of the Parque das Conchas development.</p> \n<p>Once online, Phase 3 of the BC-10 project is expected to reach a peak production of 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day (Shell share 50%, Petrobras 35%, ONGC 15%). Since coming on-stream in 2009, the BC-10 project has produced more than 70 million boe. Phase 2 of the project, to tie-in the Argonauta O-North field, continues to progress and is expected to come online late 2013 with a peak production of 35,000 boe per day (Shell share 50%, Petrobras 35%, ONGC 15%).</p> \n<p>At the Bijupir&aacute;/Salema fields, a re-development is underway that includes the drilling of four new production wells. This is expected to boost production from these fields to a peak of 35,000 boe per day in 2014 (Shell share 80%, Petrobras 20%).

The total capital investment for the two bundles of projects is around $3.9 billion. SPDC has also announced today a strategic review of the interests that it holds in selected onshore leases in the SPDC JV.",
      "maintext": "<p>SPDC Managing Director, Mutiu Sunmonu said: “Today’s announcements demonstrate our long term commitment to Nigeria by clearly signaling our intent for the strategic direction of Shell in Nigeria.”</p><h2>New investment in Nigeria oil and gas</h2><p>The Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP) is important for Nigeria, pumping some 180,000 barrels per day of crude oil to the Bonny Export Terminal and is part of the gas liquids evacuation infrastructure, critical for continued domestic power generation (Afam VI power plant) and liquefied gas exports.</p> \n<p>Sections of the TNP have been heavily impacted by sabotage and crude oil theft. The design of the TNPL includes improvements which make the pipeline better protected against crude oil theft and sabotage, which should help to reduce pollution related to criminal activity which was a key aspect of a 2011 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report on Ogoniland. The total capital investment for the TNPL project bundle is expected to be $1.5 billion.</p> \n<p>The Gbaran-Ubie Phase Two project consists of five gas supply and infrastructure projects which are critical for the continued gas supply to the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant and the Gbaran-Ubie domestic power plant (IPP). The total investment for the Gbaran-Ubie Phase Two bundle is $2.4 billion. The expected peak production from these projects is 215 kboe per day (100%).</p> \n<p>Mutiu Sunmonu commented: “These investments will help to secure energy supplies for domestic and international markets.&nbsp; The TNPL project demonstrates the tangible steps SPDC and its partners are taking to tackle the scourge of criminal activity - pipeline sabotage and crude theft in the Niger Delta, which is the cause of so much environmental and economic damage in this region.”</p><h2>Strategic review of SPDC interests in selected onshore leases</h2><p>Today, Shell's 100%-owned subsidiary, SPDC, announced the initiation of a strategic review, consultation with partners, and the potential exit from the interests it holds in some further onshore leases in the Eastern part of the Niger Delta, subject to partner and regulatory approvals. The SPDC JV produced around 750 kboe per day of oil and gas in 2012 from 28 Oil Mining Licenses (OMLs) across the Niger Delta, both onshore and in the near offshore. SPDC has been following a strategy of selective divestments of its onshore portfolio, concentrating the operating footprint into a smaller, more contiguous area, while supporting the Government’s policy of encouraging investment by indigenous companies in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Since 2010, SPDC has sold its interest in eight OMLs for a total of $1.8 billion.</p> \n<p>Mutiu Sunmonu further commented: “Nigeria remains an important part of Shell’s portfolio, with clear growth potential, particularly in deepwater and onshore gas. This strategic review marks another step in re-focusing the SPDC portfolio.” </p><h2>Notes for editors</h2><p>The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) is the operator of an unincorporated joint venture (SPDC JV) with the Nigerian state oil company NNPC, Total E&amp;P Nigeria Limited (“TOTAL”) and Nigerian AGIP Oil Company Limited (“NAOC”).</p> \n<p>TNPL is proposed to be executed by three indigenous contractors who have grown steadily over the past five years from medium sized companies to big players in the industry. The construction of the Gbaran-Ubie Phase Two project includes local and international companies. The estimated Nigerian Content value in terms of in-country manpower, goods and services that will be utilized in the execution of these projects is over 66%.</p> \n<p>The social and economic benefits to the local communities are substantial. Aside from direct employment, many of the sub contractors will come from the local communities in line with the JV partners’ local content commitment to develop capabilities within the Niger Delta region. There will also be direct social investment in skills growth and direct investment via the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMOU) model.</p> \n<p>Figures for oil &amp; gas production and capital investment in this press release are shown on a 100% joint venture basis. </p><h2>Enquiries:</h2><p><b>Shell Media Relations:</b></p> \n<p>International&nbsp;+44 207 934 5550<br /> Americas&nbsp;+1 713 241 4544</p> \n<p><b>Shell Investor Relations:</b></p> \n<p>International +31 70 377 4540<br /> North America +1 713 241 1042</p><h2>Cautionary note</h2><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

      "summary": "The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) joint venture shut the Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP) yesterday (19th June) following an explosion and fire at a crude theft point on the 28” section of the facility at Bodo West in Ogoniland. ",
      "maintext": "<p>Prior to the incident, SPDC had shut down the 28” TNP to remove crude theft connections, and has now closed the 24” TNP as a precautionary response to the fire. This means that the entire TNP system, comprising the 28” and 24” pipelines have been shut-in. The 24” TNP will be reopened when it is safe to do so, while the 28” TNP will remain shut-in until the fire has been extinguished and investigation and damage assessment completed.</p> \n<p>Some 150,000 barrels of oil per day is deferred from the closure of TNP.</p> \n<p>“This is another sad reminder of the tragic consequences of crude oil theft,” said SPDC Managing Director and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mutiu Sunmonu. “Unknown persons continued to reconnect illegal bunkering hoses at Bodo West even as our pipeline team were removing crude theft points. It was therefore not surprising that the fire occurred from the continuing illegal bunkering even as a previous crude oil theft point was being repaired by the team. So far, there is practically no spill from this event as the oil is burning off. What is visible in the water is from an earlier oil spill which was also as a result of oil theft.</p> \n<p>“The explosion also triggered a fire on a nearby barge. Crude theft continues to pose significant challenges to the people, environment and the local and national economy, and all stakeholders must work together to stop this criminal activity.”</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><b>Shell Media Relations:</b><br /> International: +44 207 934 5550<br /> Americas: +1 713 241 4544</p> \n<p><b>Shell Investor Relations:</b><br /> International: +31 70 377 4540<br /> North America: +1 713 241 1042</p><p><b>Cautionary note</b></p> \n<p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.<br /> <br /> </p><h2>Reference ADS Price</h2><p>ADS stands for “American Depositary Share”. ADR stands for “American Depositary Receipt”. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably). ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.<br /> </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>Q1 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Reference ADS price (US$)<br /> </td> \n   <td>67.888<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS. A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary. Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price. The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs and B ADSs.<br /> </p> \n<p>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme. Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website: <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.<br /> </p><h2>Scrip dividend programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br /> </p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br /> </p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br /> </p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.<br /> </p>",

      "summary": "In an important step, Shell has laid the keel for Prelude FLNG, the world’s first floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project. When complete, Prelude is expected to be the largest offshore floating facility ever built. The hull will now be assembled in the dry dock, before the turret and the topsides are fitted at Samsung Heavy Industries’ Geoje shipyard in South Korea.",
      "maintext": "<p>“This is a key milestone in Prelude’s story,” said Rob Kretzers, Shell Executive Vice President Projects. “Innovative thinking and leading edge technology, as well as hard work from those at Shell and our partners, have helped us reach this significant point in construction. Prelude’s size and scale is unprecedented and I look forward to seeing this enormous structure take shape. Shell is pioneering FLNG which has the potential to revolutionise the way natural gas resources are developed”.<br /> </p> \n<p>FLNG will allow Shell to produce natural gas at sea, turn it into liquefied natural gas and then transfer it directly to the ships that will transport it to customers. It will open up new opportunities for countries looking to develop their gas resources and bring more natural gas to market.<br /> </p> \n<p>Large steel sections known as “blocks” that will form the hull are being manufactured in the Geoje shipyard, with more than 1,600 already complete. One section can be the size of a large house. The 93-metre high turret mooring system is under construction in Dubai and will be transported to Geoje in five parts. The turret will run vertically through one end of the facility and will be anchored to the seabed by four groups of mooring lines. It will allow the facility to rotate with the direction of the wind.<br /> </p> \n<p>Once complete, the 600,000 tonnes facility will be almost half a kilometre in length (488 metres or 1,601 feet), which is longer than four soccer fields, and will displace six times as much water as the largest aircraft carrier. It will be moored and hooked up to the undersea infrastructure, around 475 kilometres north-east of Broome, Western Australia.<br /> </p> \n<p>Despite its huge dimensions, the facility is only one-quarter the size of an equivalent plant on land. Shell’s technology has been adapted for floating LNG, and engineers designed components that will stack vertically to save space. The cooling plant, for example, will be placed above the vast storage tanks that have a capacity equivalent to around 175 Olympic swimming pools. Specially designed tubes, known as risers, will draw 50 million litres of cold water from the ocean every hour to help cool the natural gas.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shell has started to build the organisational capacity in Australia to support the installation and operational phases. Deliveries of equipment to support the drilling operations are under way and Shell has awarded the contract for the Prelude supply base in Darwin, while the recruitment of operations staff began in March 2013.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shell is leading the delivery of this mega project, working with long-term strategic partners Technip and Samsung Heavy Industries (the Technip Samsung Consortium). Prelude is the first of what is expected to be multiple Shell FLNG projects. The expertise gained from the Prelude project will help develop potential future floating facilities.<br /> </p><h2>ENQUIRIES:</h2><p>Shell International Media Relations +44 (0) 20 7934 5550</p> \n<p>Shell Australia Media Relations +61 417 007 344</p><h2>Notes to Editors</h2><p><b>About Prelude</b><br /> </p> \n<p>Since 2012, Australian subsidiaries of INPEX Corporation (17.5%), Korea Gas Corporation (10%) and CPC Corporation (5%) have joined the Prelude FLNG project. &nbsp;<br /> </p> \n<p>FLNG will enable the development of gas resources ranging from clusters of smaller more remote fields to potentially larger fields via multiple facilities where, for a range of reasons, an onshore development is not viable. This can mean faster, cheaper, more flexible development and deployment strategies for resources that were previously uneconomic, or constrained by technical or other risks.<br /> </p> \n<p>Many of the technologies used on the FLNG facility are ones that Shell has used successfully onshore, but some have been extended or modified for offshore.&nbsp; The new technology that has been developed for FLNG includes LNG tanks that can handle sloshing, close coupling between the producing wells and the LNG processing facility, LNG offloading arms, water intake risers, mooring systems and the marinisation of processing equipment such as absorption columns and the main cryogenic heat exchangers. All of these technologies have been extensively modelled and tested to ensure they can operate safely and efficiently under marine.</p> \n<p>More information, photos and videos can be found at: <a class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/flng\">http://www.shell.com/flng</a>.

      "summary": "Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) today announces a final investment decision in the Stones ultra-deepwater project, a Gulf of Mexico oil and gas development expected to host the deepest production facility in the world. This decision sets in motion the construction and fabrication of a floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea infrastructure. ",
      "maintext": "<p>The development will start with two subsea production wells tied back to the FPSO vessel, followed later by six additional production wells.&nbsp; This first phase of development is expected to have annual peak production of 50,000 boe/d from more than 250 million boe of recoverable resources.&nbsp; The Stones field has significant upside potential and is estimated to contain over 2 billion boe of oil in place.</p> \n<p>“This important investment demonstrates our ongoing commitment to usher in the next generation of deepwater developments, which will deliver more production growth in the Americas,” said John Hollowell, Executive Vice President for Deepwater, Shell Upstream Americas. “We will continue our leadership in safe, innovative deepwater operations to help meet the growing demand for energy in the US.” &nbsp;<br /> <br /> The Stones field is located in 9,500 feet (2,896 meters) of water, approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana, and was discovered in 2005. The project encompasses eight US Federal Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico’s Lower Tertiary geologic trend. Shell has been one of the pioneers in the Lower Tertiary, establishing first production in the play from its Perdido Development. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> An FPSO design was selected to safely develop and produce this ultra-deepwater discovery, while addressing the relative lack of infrastructure, seabed complexity, and unique reservoir properties. With an FPSO, tankers will transport oil from the Stones FPSO to US refineries, and gas will be transported by pipeline.<br /> </p> \n<p>The launch of the Stones development is a key milestone as Shell continues to grow deepwater exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico, having made significant progress recently on the Mars-B development project with the arrival of the Olympus tension leg platform. Shell is also in the concept selection phase for the Appomattox and Vito discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico.<br /> <br /> Shell holds 100% interest and will operate the Stones development.<br /> </p><h2>Enquiries:</h2><p><b>Media:</b><br /> Shell US Media Relations +1 713 241 4544<br /> Shell International Media Relations +44 (0) 20 7934 5550<br /> </p> \n<p><b>Investor Relations:</b><br /> International&nbsp; + 31 (0) 70 377 4540<br /> North America +1 713 241 1042<br /> &nbsp;</p><h2>EDITOR’S NOTES:</h2><p>• A turret with a disconnectable buoy will allow the FPSO vessel to weathervane in normal conditions and to disconnect from the well system and sail to safe areas in the event of adverse weather conditions.<br /> <br /> • A lazy wave riser configuration will be used, consisting of a steel catenary riser with buoyancy added with an arch bend to decouple the FPSO dynamic motions and subsequently increase riser performance.<br /> <br /> • A combination of polyester rope and chain comprises the ultra-deepwater mooring system holding the FPSO on station.<br /> <br /> • Multiphase seafloor pumping is planned for use in a later phase to pump oil and gas from the seabed to the FPSO, increasing recoverable volumes and production rates.</p><p><b>Royal Dutch Shell plc</b><br /> </p> \n<p>Royal Dutch Shell plc is incorporated in England and Wales, has its headquarters in The Hague and is listed on the London, Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges.

      "maintext": "<h2>Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser commented:</h2><p>&nbsp;“Our industry continues to see significant energy price volatility as a result of economic and political developments. Oil prices have fallen recently but Shell is implementing a long-term, competitive and innovative strategy against this volatile backdrop.”</p> \n<p>“Shell's underlying CCS earnings were $7.5 billion for the quarter, a 2% increase in CCS earnings per share from the first quarter of 2012. These results were underpinned by Shell's growth projects, an improvement in downstream profitability, and were delivered despite a difficult security environment in Nigeria.”</p> \n<p>“Our profits pay for Shell's dividends and investment in new projects to ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies for our customers, and to add value for our shareholders.”</p> \n<p>“Shell is investing for profitable growth, whilst maintaining strong capital discipline. We are developing some 30 new projects and maturing a series of further opportunities for investment. So far this year, we’ve seen the growth impact of recent start ups and we took four final investment decisions in petrochemicals, deepwater, and LNG.”</p> \n<p>“We continue to take a dynamic approach to portfolio” continued Voser. “Asset sales - $0.6 billion in the first quarter and over $21 billion in the last three years - improve our capital efficiency and can bring in strategic partners. We use selective acquisitions to refresh our opportunity set.”</p> \n<p>Voser commented “We distributed $11 billion of dividends over the last year, the highest in our industry, and today we confirm a 5% rise in our dividend to $0.45 per share.”</p> \n<p>He concluded “Dividends are Shell’s main route for returning cash to shareholders. Our improving cash flow also enables us to accelerate our share buyback programme, this year so far we have repurchased some $1.2 billion of shares by the end of April. In the current environment we would expect to more than offset the scrip dividend issue this year, and we are determined to implement the policy to offset dilution over the business cycle. This underlines our commitment to shareholder returns.”</p><img src=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/investor/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>First quarter 2013 results video comment</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/financial-information/quarterlyresults/2013/1st-quarter-2013-unaudited-results/video.html\">Watch Simon Henry, Chief Financial Officer of Royal Dutch Shell plc, comment on the 2013 first quarter results</a></li></ul><h2>First quarter 2013 results documents</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/financial-information/quarterlyresults/2013/1st-quarter-2013-unaudited-results.html\">Online version of Quarterly Results Announcement (results in full)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s06.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-qra.pdf\">PDF of Quarterly Results Announcement (results in full)</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure.xls\">Excel of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure.pdf\">PDF of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li></ul><h2>Restatement of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</h2><p>This version of the Supplementary financial and operational disclosure shows variances compared with previously-published information for periods Q4 2008-Q4 2012, as a result of the adoption of revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits on January 1, 2013, with retrospective effect.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure-restatement.pdf\">PDF of restatement of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s03.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure-restatement.xls\">Excel of restatement of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li></ul><h2>First quarter 2013 results webcast</h2><p>Simon Henry, Chief Financial Officer of Royal Dutch Shell hosted audio webcasts of the first quarter results 2013 on Thursday May 2 2013.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://cache.merchantcantos.com/webcast/static/ec2mc/4000/5275/5345/10816/Lobby/default.htm\">Media webcast</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cache.merchantcantos.com/webcast/static/ec2mc/4000/5275/5345/10812/Lobby/default.htm\">Analyst webcast</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-analyst-presentation-transcript.pdf\">PDF of transcript of presentation to analysts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-media-presentation-transcript.pdf\">PDF of transcript of presentation to media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-presentation-slides-final.pdf\">PDF of presentation slides</a></li></ul><p><sup>* If you are accessing this page on an iPad or iPhone,&nbsp;please download&nbsp;and install our </sup><a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/news-and-library/follow-us/app.html\"><sup>Investor &amp; Media app</sup></a><sup> and go to the Results section to listen to these webcasts.</sup></p><h2>First quarter 2013 dividend announcement</h2><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/dividend-information/historical-payments/2013/q1.html\">First quarter 2013 interim dividend announcement</a>",

      "summary": "South Gas Company, Shell and Mitsubishi today officially announced the commencement of operations of Basrah Gas Company, which will be the largest gas project in Iraq’s history and the world’s largest flares reduction project.",
      "maintext": "<p>Basrah Gas Company is a 25-year incorporated Joint Venture between Iraq’s South Gas Company holding 51% of its shares, Shell 44% and Mitsubishi Corporation 5%. The Joint Venture captures associated gas that is currently being flared from three oil fields in southern Iraq – Rumaila, West Qurna 1 and Zubair.</p> \n<p>Iraq has estimated natural gas reserves totaling 112.6 trillion cubic feet, the 10th largest in the world. However, due to decades of wars and sanctions that led to the deterioration of the gas infrastructure, preliminary estimates indicate that Iraq’s losses from gas flaring could amount to billions of dollars annually*.</p> \n<p>Mr. Ali Khudair, South Gas Company Director General said: “Basrah produces only around 1 billion cubic feet a day of associated gas and some 700 million cubic feet are being flared, which is wasting millions of dollars of the country’s resources every day. Partnering with world class companies like Shell and Mitsubishi will help Iraq fulfil its goal of developing its gas infrastructure to eliminate flaring and provide fuel to the Iraqi industry, power generation as well as income to the state.”</p> \n<p>Under the agreement signed with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, BGC will sell processed gas to state-owned South Gas Company. BGC will be dedicated to the rehabilitation and upgrade of the current facilities to put them back to work safely as well as building new assets which is expected to increase the production capacity from a current 400 million cubic feet per day to 2 billion cubic feet per day. Since the agreements were signed at the end of November 2011, SGC and Shell have increased production capacity from ca 240 million scf/d to around 400million scf/d of gas throughput, initiated a number of safety training activities to raise awareness and safety standards at operations with more than 8,500 training courses completed. Lastly, a number of critical projects have already started, like the new power plant at the Khor Al Zubair (KAZ) gas plant, compressor stations in North Rumaila, as well as leasing compressors to reduce gas flaring in the Zubair field.</p> \n<p>In the future, the project also includes the option to build an LNG plant for potential export once domestic energy needs are met, which will create a new income stream and help the country increase the pace of its economic growth.</p> \n<p>“The birth of this JV is a clear testament to the determination of the Iraqi Government to develop the country’s energy sector and a true reflection to the significant improvement in the security situation that is stimulating investments in Basrah.” said Basrah Gas Company Managing Director, Mr. Gasser Hanter. “Our main priority is to harness Iraq’s wasted gas resources and provide its people with much-needed reliable and clean energy, whilst helping to reduce the environmental impact caused by the flared gas in Basrah”</p> \n<p>BGC is expected to create significant value for Iraq and help improve the local economy through providing a reliable and clean gas supply for power generation, thereby considerably reducing gas flaring. This in turn will help enhancing Basrah’s air quality, building the local staff capabilities to international standards and hiring local suppliers.</p> \n<p>Mr. Hans Nijkamp, Shell Iraq Chairman said: “I am very pleased to see this project becoming a reality. Shell is committed to provide BGC with technology, funding, international best practices, and experienced personnel who can help build the required capabilities across the organization which compliments SGC’s long experience on the ground in Iraq, resulting in increased energy supply to the Iraqi people”.</p> \n<p><i>* According to the World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction&nbsp;Partnership</i></p><h2>Enquiries:</h2><p><b>Shell Media Relations</b><br /> International +44 207 934 5550<br /> Middle East &amp; North Africa +971 470 55347<b></b></p> \n<p><b>Shell Investor Relations</b><br /> International +31 70 377 4540<br /> North America +1 713 241 1042</p><h2>Cautionary note</h2><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

Production of some 150,000 barrels of oil per day has been deferred due to the shutdown. As a result, SPDC has declared force majeure on Bonny Light export.",
      "maintext": "<p>“We’re concerned that the NCTL has been targeted by crude oil thieves repeatedly since we installed the new line in 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion,” said Managing Director of SPDC &amp; Country Chair, Shell Nigeria, Mutiu Sunmonu. “The current exercise aims to remove a significant number of oil theft connections and repair any leaks on the pipeline. We recognise efforts by the security forces to contain the crime, and SPDC will work with them during the shutdown to clear illegal connections on the NCTL.”<br /> <br /> The 97-kilometre NCTL has been closed several times as a result of crude oil theft leaks and fires between December 2011 and May 2012.<br /> <br /> Mr. Sunmonu added: “Crude theft continues to affect people, the environment and the economy, and urgent action is needed by all stakeholders to tackle the problem.”<br /> </p><p><b>Cautionary statement</b><br /> The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

      "summary": "Shell is ready to invest several hundred million dollars in emerging technology companies, with the aim to accelerate the deployment of innovations that add value to the company’s operations. From smarter exploration processes to enhanced extraction techniques, Shell’s corporate venturing arm Shell Technology Ventures will make investments over the next six to eight years.",
      "maintext": "<p>Gerald Schotman, Executive Vice President Innovation, R&amp;D and Shell Chief Technology Officer, said:</p> \n<p>“Ideas from outside the organisation are critical to our open innovation approach to R&amp;D. We want to enable the brightest and the best to develop their ideas, and benefit from Shell’s expertise and global reach, so that we can get these technologies up and running in our projects as fast as we can.”</p> \n<p>As well as promising technology companies, Shell is looking to invest in technology spin-outs and externally-managed venture capital funds. The company will look at areas including gas production and conversion; geophysical imaging; chemical manufacturing and conversion; novel materials; enhanced oil recovery; and water treatment. Various aspects of information technology (“Big Data”); oil and gas wells drilling and completion; sub-surface sensing; production in challenging environments; operational efficiency; and future energy technologies will also be sought.</p> \n<p>Partners may be granted access to Shell’s technical experts, its global research capability and its customer, supplier and contractor base. Shell may look to enable field trials where appropriate and serve as a launching customer for these new technologies. Companies are encouraged to submit their proposals via the process as set out at <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/innovation/shell-technology-ventures.html\" class=\"shell\">www.shell.com/techventures</a>.</p> \n<p>Geert van de Wouw, Shell Technology Ventures Director, said:</p> \n<p>“We are looking to develop long-term mutually, beneficial partnerships with emerging technology companies, venture capital firms and corporate venturing organisations. A good example of where this is already working is our investment in GlassPoint Solar Inc. Their pilot plant in the Middle East taps heat from the sun to generate steam for enhanced oil recovery. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) contracted GlassPoint to build the plant, which is currently being tested.” </p> \n<p>Shell Technology Ventures is the corporate venturing arm of Shell and follows the existing Shell Technology Ventures Fund 1, which is managed by independent Kenda Capital.

      "summary": "Through further investments in LNG for Transport, Shell plans to utilize North American natural gas\nto provide an innovative and cost-effective fuel for its commercial customers.\n",
      "maintext": "<p>Shell and its affiliates plan to bring liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel one step closer for its marine and heavy-duty on-road customers in North America by taking a final investment decision on two small-scale liquefaction units. These two units will form the basis of two new LNG transport corridors in the Great Lakes and Gulf Coast regions. This decision follows an investment decision in 2011 on a similar corridor in Alberta, Canada. Shell is also working to use natural gas as a fuel in its own operations.</p> \n<p>“Natural gas is an abundant and cleaner-burning energy source in North America, and Shell is leveraging its LNG expertise and integrated strength to make LNG a viable fuel option for the commercial market,” said Marvin Odum, President, Shell Oil Company. “We are investing now in the infrastructure that will allow us to bring this innovative and cost-competitive fuel to our customers.”</p> \n<p>In the Gulf Coast Corridor, Shell plans to install a small-scale liquefaction unit (0.25 million tons per annum) at its Shell Geismar Chemicals facility in Geismar, Louisiana, in the United States. Once operational, this unit will supply LNG along the Mississippi River, the Intra-Coastal Waterway and to the offshore Gulf of Mexico and the onshore oil and gas exploration areas of Texas and Louisiana. To service oil and gas and other industrial customers in Texas and Louisiana, Shell is expanding its existing relationship with fuels and lubricants re-seller Martin Energy Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Martin Resource Management Corporation (MRMC). MRMC and its publicly traded affiliate, Martin Midstream Partners L.P. will provide terminalling, storage, transportation and distribution of LNG.</p> \n<p>Shell has a memorandum of understanding with Edison Chouest Offshore companies (ECO) to supply LNG fuel to marine vessels that operate in the Gulf of Mexico and to provide what is anticipated to be the first LNG barging and bunkering operation in North America at Port Fourchon, Louisiana. The LNG transport barges will move the fuel from the Geismar production site to Port Fourchon where it will be bunkered into customer vessels.</p> \n<p>In the Great Lakes Corridor, Shell plans to install a small-scale liquefaction unit (0.25 million tons per annum) at its Shell Sarnia Manufacturing Centre in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Once operational, this project will supply LNG fuel to all five Great Lakes, their bordering U.S. states and Canadian provinces and the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Interlake Steamship Company is expected to be the first marine customer in this region, as it begins the conversion of its vessels.</p> \n<p>Pending final regulatory permitting, these two new liquefaction units are expected to begin operations and production in about three years.</p> \n<p>Shell is also working to use LNG as a fuel in its own operations or to support its operations.&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Offshore Support Services: Shell has chartered three dual-fuel offshore support vessels (STX SV310DF) from Harvey Gulf International Marine utilizing W&auml;rtsil&auml; engine and LNG system technology.&nbsp; These vessels will be used to support Shell’s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Onshore Production: Shell has also begun to transition many of its onshore drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing spreads to LNG. These conversions can reduce fuel costs and local emissions.<br /> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Given Shell’s leading expertise across the LNG value chain and its competitive position in the commercial fuel market, this extension into the North American market is a good fit for Shell and its customers.<br /> </p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p>Natural gas could play an important role in helping to meet the world’s rising transport needs. It can be converted into different forms to power ships, trucks, buses and planes.<b></b></p> \n<p><b>Liquefied natural gas</b></p> \n<p>Cooling natural gas to around -162&deg;C (-260&deg;F) turns it into a liquid and shrinks its volume for easier shipment and storage. At Shell, we are exploring ways to broaden the use of LNG, from the traditional power generation sector to fuelling more of the world’s growing commercial transport fleets and vessels.</p> \n<p>LNG also has the potential to be used in sectors such as rail and mining and we are looking at options to increase its use in our own operations.<b></b></p> \n<p><b>LNG in the water</b></p> \n<p>LNG is already being used as a fuel for vessels on inland waterways, such as ferries in Norway, and has the potential to be used more widely: by cruisers, ferries, barges and tug boats.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Europe and North America new environmental regulations require shipping operators to reduce local emissions. LNG fuel, which is virtually free of sulphur and particulates, will help them meet these requirements.</p> \n<p>We <a class=\"shell\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/media/news-and-media-releases/2012/share-purchase-agreement-gasnor.html\">bought Gasnor</a>, a leading LNG fuel company in Norway that supplies industrial and marine operators, as we work to deliver LNG to more customers. We also plan to <a class=\"shell\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/solutions-for-businesses/shipping-trading/about-shell-shipping/lng-barges-05092012.html\">charter the first inland barges</a> to run purely on LNG, which will sail on the Rhine in 2013. <b></b></p> \n<p><b>LNG on the road</b></p> \n<p>Often trucks delivering goods across the globe run on diesel. LNG has the potential to offer significant fuel cost savings compared to conventional diesel.

      "title": "New Shell scenarios sharpen focus on future for society, energy",
      "summary": "Shell today released new scenarios that explore two possible ways the 21st century could unfold, with dramatically different implications for society and the world’s energy system. One scenario sees cleaner-burning natural gas becoming the most important energy source globally by the 2030s and early action to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The other sees solar becoming the top source by about 2070, but with slower action to address the threat of climate change. ",
      "maintext": "<p>The New Lens Scenarios, which look at trends in the economy, politics and energy as far ahead as 2100, underscore the critical role that government policies could play in shaping the future.</p> \n<p>“These scenarios show how the choices made by governments, businesses and individuals in the next few years will have a major impact on the way the future unfolds,” said Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser. “They highlight the need for business and government to find new ways to collaborate, fostering policies that promote the development and use of cleaner energy, and improve energy efficiency.” </p> \n<p>With the world’s population headed toward 9.5 billion by 2060 and the rapid growth of emerging economies lifting millions of people out of poverty for the first time, the scenarios project that world energy demand could double over the next 50 years.</p> \n<p>Called Mountains and Oceans, Shell’s scenarios explore two plausible future pathways for society. Each scenario dives into the implications for the pace of global economic development, the types of energy we use to power our lives and the growth in greenhouse gas emissions. </p> \n<p>The scenarios look further into the future than many other outlooks and highlight some surprising possible developments. Both see global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) dropping to near zero by 2100. One factor is increasing use of technology that takes CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere, for instance by burning biomass to produce electricity, and then storing emissions underground. Although the Oceans scenario sees a dramatic increase in solar power, it also envisions greater fossil fuel use and higher total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over the century than the Mountains scenario, which will likely have more impact on the world’s climate.</p> \n<p>The scenarios highlight areas of public policy likely to have the greatest influence on the development of cleaner fuels and renewables, improvements in energy efficiency and on moderating greenhouse gas emissions. They include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Measures to promote the development of compact, energy-efficient cities, particularly in Asia and other rapidly urbanising parts of the world.</li> \n <li>Mandates for greater efficiency in areas such as transportation and buildings. &nbsp;</li> \n <li>Policies to encourage the safe development of the world’s abundant supply of cleaner-burning natural gas -- and to promote its wider use in power generation, transport and other areas.</li> \n <li>A price on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and other incentives to speed the adoption of technologies to manage emissions, particularly carbon capture and storage (CCS). &nbsp;</li> \n</ul><h2>Mountains</h2><p>The Mountains scenario imagines a world of more moderate economic development in which policy plays an important role in shaping the world’s energy system and environmental pathway. Cleaner-burning natural gas becomes the backbone of the world’s energy system, in many places replacing coal as a fuel for power generation and seeing wider use in transport.</p> \n<p>A profound shift in the transportation sector sees global demand for oil peaking in about 2035. By the end of the century, cars and trucks powered by electricity and hydrogen could dominate the road. Technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power stations, refineries and other industrial installations becomes widely used, helping to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the power sector to zero by 2060. Another factor is the growth of nuclear power in global electricity generation. Its market share increases by around 25% in the period to 2060.</p> \n<p>With these changes to the energy system, greenhouse gas emissions begin to fall after 2030. Nevertheless, emissions remain on a trajectory to overshoot the target of limiting global temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius.<br /> </p><h2>Oceans</h2><p>The Oceans scenario envisions a more prosperous, volatile world with an energy landscape shaped mostly by market forces and civil society, with government policy playing a less prominent role. Public resistance and the slow adoption of both policies and technology limit the development of nuclear power and restrict the growth of natural gas outside North America. Coal remains widely used in power generation until at least the middle of the century.</p> \n<p>Without strong support from policymakers, carbon capture and storage catches on slowly. By mid-century CCS captures only about 10% of emissions, growing to about 25% in 2075. This slow uptake is the main reason electricity generation becomes carbon-neutral some 30 years later in the Oceans scenario than in the Mountains scenario.</p> \n<p>Higher energy prices encourage the development of hard-to-reach oil resources, as well as the expansion of biofuel production. Oil demand continues to grow through the 20s and 30s, reaching a plateau after 2040. Liquid fuels still account for about 70% of road passenger travel by mid-century.</p> \n<p>High prices also spur strong efficiency gains and the development of solar power. By 2070, solar photovoltaic panels become the world’s largest primary source of energy. Wind energy expands at a slower pace, due to public opposition to large installations of wind turbines.</p> \n<p>Elevated demand for coal and oil, a lack of support for CCS and less natural gas development outside of North America contributes to about 25% higher total greenhouse gas emissions than in the Mountains scenario.</p> \n<p>To explore Mountains and Oceans in more detail, download Shell’s New Lens Scenarios at <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scenarios\">www.shell.com/scenarios</a>.</p> \n<p>Shell has a 40-year history of using scenario planning to explore possible future landscapes and aid strategic decision-making. The latest publication continues a tradition of sharing summaries of the scenarios to contribute to the public debate about possible ways to tackle some of society’s long-term challenges.<br /> </p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p>Shell International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550</p><p><b>Cautionary note</b></p> \n<p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

      "maintext": "<p>“We’ve made progress in Alaska, but this is a long-term programme that we are pursuing in a safe and measured way,” said &nbsp;Marvin Odum, Director, Upstream Americas.&nbsp; “Our decision to pause in 2013 will give us time to ensure the readiness of all our equipment and people following the drilling season in 2012.”</p> \n<p>Alaska holds important energy resources. At the same time, securing access to those resources requires special expertise, technology and an in depth understanding of the environmental and societal sensitivities unique to the region. Shell is one of the leaders in an industry move into offshore Arctic exploration. The company continues to use its extensive experience in Arctic and sub-Arctic environments to prepare for safe activities in Alaska.</p> \n<p>Alaska remains an area with high potential for Shell over the long term, and the company is committed to drill there again in the future. If exploration proves successful, resources there would take years to develop.</p> \n<p>Shell completed top-hole drilling on two wells in 2012 in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, marking the industry’s return to offshore drilling in the Alaskan Arctic after more than a decade. This drilling was completed safely, with no serious injuries or environmental impact.&nbsp; After the drilling season ended, however, one of Shell’s drilling rigs, the Kulluk, was damaged in a maritime incident related to strong weather conditions. The Kulluk and the second drilling rig, the Noble Discoverer, will be towed to locations in Asia for maintenance and repairs.</p> \n<p>“Shell remains committed to building an Arctic exploration program that provides confidence to stakeholders and regulators, and meets the high standards the company applies to its operations around the world,” said Odum. “We continue to believe that a measured and responsible pace, especially in the exploration phase, fits best in this remote area.</p><h2>Notes for editors</h2><p>Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Shell”) is a leading oil and gas exploration player, with upstream activities in over 50 countries world-wide. Exploration and deals in conventional basins and resources plays added 12 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) resources for Shell in 2010-2012.</p> \n<p>Shell has ambitious exploration plans worldwide. Exploration drilling activity will step up in 2013-14. Shell expects to drill over 40 high-potential wells in 18 conventional basins, and test 10 key resources plays for tight gas and liquids-rich shales.

      "summary": "The Hague, 26 February 2013. Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Shell”) continues to expand its industry leadership in Liquefied Natural Gas (“LNG”), today agreeing to acquire part of Repsol S.A’s (“Repsol”) LNG portfolio outside of North America, including supply positions in Peru and Trinidad & Tobago, for a cash consideration of $4.4 billion. Shell will also assume and consolidate balance sheet liabilities predominantly reflecting leases for LNG ship charters of currently $1.8 billion. The balance sheet impacts are subject to final assessment prior to completion of the transaction. ",
      "maintext": "<p>“Shell’s world-wide LNG supply position and customer base means we are uniquely positioned to add value to Repsol’s LNG portfolio, including through Shell’s trading capabilities,” said Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser. “By optimising the combined portfolios we will increase our ability to bring LNG to areas that need it the most, adding value for Shell, our partners and our customers.”<br /> <br /> The acquisition will add a new dynamic to Shell’s portfolio, namely LNG capacity in the West Atlantic from Atlantic LNG in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and in the East Pacific from Peru LNG. These additions will complement Shell’s existing LNG capacity in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and Russia. The acquisition should add some 7.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG volumes through long-term off-take agreements, including some 4 mtpa of equity LNG plant capacity. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Shell expects to add value to this portfolio by optimizing the new LNG flows in our world-wide customer base. Subject to successful completion, the new portfolio is expected to immediately provide additional cash flow to Shell, with limited on-going capital expenditure requirements.<br /> <br /> The transaction, which has an effective date of 1 October 2012, is expected to close in the second half of 2013 or early 2014, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions precedent.</p><h2>Additional information:</h2><p>Shell has agreed to acquire from several Repsol subsidiaries which own key LNG businesses of Repsol. Upon completion, after securing regulatory approvals and meeting other conditions precedent, the transaction will add:<br /> <br /> a) Net 4.2 mtpa equity LNG plant capacity comprising:<br /> • ALNG trains 1-4 14.6 mtpa capacity, on a 100% basis (20-25% equity per train); operated by Atlantic LNG Company of Trinidad and Tobago<br /> • Peru LNG 4.45 mtpa capacity, on a 100% basis (acquisition: 20% equity; 100% offtake); operated by Peru LNG Company<br /> • BBE power plant in Spain (25%, 800MW); operated by Bah&iacute;a de Bizkaia Electricidad S.L.<br /> • A fleet of LNG carriers, comprising both long term and short term time charters.<br /> <br /> b) A material LNG marketing and trading operation, with 7.2 mtpa of LNG volumes through long-term off-take agreements.<br /> <br /> c) As part of this agreement, Shell has committed to supply around 0.1 mtpa of LNG to Repsol’s Canaport LNG terminal in Canada over a period of 10 years.<br /> </p><p>Enquiries:<br /> <br /> Shell Media Relations<br /> International +44 207 934 5550<br /> Americas +1 713 241 4544<br /> <br /> Shell Investor Relations<br /> International +31 70 377 4540<br /> North America +1 713 241 1042</p><h2>Cautionary note</h2><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.<br /> </p><h2>Reference ADS Price</h2><p>ADS stands for “American Depositary Share”. ADR stands for “American Depositary Receipt”. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably). ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B.

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br /> <br /> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

      "summary": "The Hague, 31st January 2013. In an update with investors today, Shell CEO Peter Voser said the company is delivering on its strategy and he reiterated growth plans while spelling out strategic priorities.  \n",
      "maintext": "<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“With the first year of our 2012-2015 growth targets completed, Shell is on track for plans we set out in early 2012, despite headwinds last year,” said Voser. “Shell is competitive and innovative. We are delivering a strategy that others can’t easily repeat, with unique skills in technology and integration and a worldwide set of opportunities for new investment”.</p> \n<p>Although the economic outlook remains uncertain for some of Shell’s key markets, Voser said the prospects for long-term growth in global energy demand remained unchanged, driven by rising world population and improving standards of living in developing countries.&nbsp; “Meeting this demand growth with clean and affordable energy is a formidable challenge for our industry and it is a major opportunity for Shell,” he said.</p> \n<p>He confirmed Shell’s growth agenda, which aims to deliver $175-$200 billion of total cash flow from operations for 2012-2015, a net capital spending programme of $120-$130 billion, and a competitive dividend for shareholders [1].</p> \n<p>Shell’s efforts to expand its pipeline of potential energy projects are paying off, said Voser. “Our drive to increase our options for future projects means that we are more constrained by limits on capital than by limits on opportunities,” he said. “This allows us to prioritise the most attractive opportunities, and reconfigure or exit from less attractive ones.”</p> \n<p>Voser said Shell will continue to maintain its investment programme through the economic cycle. “We make long-term decisions on capital allocation and growth choices, and we look through short-term market volatility,” he said. “As our cash flow momentum builds we expect to increase our dividends for shareholders in measured, affordable steps. There is more to come from Shell.”</p><h2>Key operational milestones in 2012:</h2><ul> \n <li>We continued to focus on safe and reliable operations in all of our activities.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Cash flow from operations (CFFO) of $46 billion, net capital investment of $30 billion, dividends announced of $11 billion.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>New start-ups in 2010-12 added $6 billion of cash flow and 600 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) of production in 2012, around 10% and 20% of the company’s totals. There is more growth to come from these assets.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Exploration, appraisal and commercial activities in 2012 added ~4 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of potential new resources, comprising 1.5 billion boe in conventional basins, and 2.5 billion boe in resources plays, underpinning Shell’s longer-term growth plans.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Rigorous portfolio management continues, with $7 billion of exits from non-core positions and strategic partnering, and $5 billion in acquisitions in 2012. Divestments in the last 3 years totalled $21 billion, or around 10% of capital employed, and acquisitions were $17 billion.</li> \n</ul><h2>Outlook for 2013 and beyond</h2><p>Voser said Shell will continue the strategic drive to grow its upstream businesses, with ongoing selective investment in downstream.</p> \n<p>At the end of 2012, the company had 12.4 billion boe of resources on stream, averaging 3.4 million boe/d of production, and 20 billion boe of resources potential in our active development funnel. Total resources in these two categories represent 26 years of current production.</p> \n<p>Shell has ~30 new projects under construction, which should unlock 7 billion barrels of resources, and drive continued financial and production growth. Upstream start-ups in 2010-15 are expected to add some $15 billion of cash flow in 2015, in a $100 oil price scenario. Some 50% of our 2013 capital investment will contribute to cash flow by 2015.</p> \n<p>Oil &amp; gas production is expected to average ~4 million boe/d in 2017-2018 compared to 3.3 million boe/d in 2012. Shell’s strategy in upstream is designed to drive financial growth, irrespective of production entitlement, with production growth regarded as a long term proxy for financial growth.</p> \n<p>Shell expects to announce a dividend of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2013, a 4.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2012 and year-ago levels.</p> \n<p>Shell is allocating capital according to specific strategic themes, with unique technology, fiscal and market characteristics, and executing a global portfolio strategy. By looking at strategy through this thematic lens, Shell can allocate capital and technology most effectively in each play.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>For 2013, we expect $33 billion of net capital investment. Organic capital investment in 2013 is expected to be $34 billion, with a further $2 billion for previously-announced acquisitions, and some $3 billion of asset sales.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Capital allocation, including exploration, will follow a similar pattern to 2012, with investment directed to Shell’s distinct strategic themes.<br /> <br /> \n  <ul> \n   <li>$12 billion in upstream and downstream engines – the mature, cash-generative businesses in Shell, plus corporate.<br /> <br /> </li> \n   <li>Some $18 billion directed at growth priorities, in integrated gas, deep water and resources plays, allocated evenly between these three.<br /> <br /> </li> \n   <li>Future opportunities, such as Nigeria onshore, Kazakhstan, Iraq, the Arctic and heavy oil will see some $4 billion of total spending in 2013.<br /> <br /> </li> \n   <li>The increased spending from 2012-13 will be driven by higher investment in deep water and upstream engines, reflecting Shell’s project flow, and an increase in core exploration spending from $6.4 to $7 billion, allocated to Shell’s strategic themes. The 2013 capital investment programme includes an increase of some $1 billion for non-cash capitalized leases, predominantly in deep water growth projects.<br /> <br /> </li> \n   <li>Exploration drilling activity will step up in 2013-14. Shell expects to drill over 40 high-potential wells in 18 conventional basins, and test 10 key resources plays for tight gas and liquids-rich shales.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul><p>[1] Cash Flow From Operations (CFFO) and net capital spending outlook at $80-$100/bbl Brent, and assumes improved US gas and downstream environment from 2012. CFFO excludes working capital movements.</p><p><b>Cautionary statement<br /> </b></p> \n<p>Reserves: Our use of the term “reserves” in this presentation means SEC proved oil and gas reserves.</p> \n<p>Resources:&nbsp; Our use of the term “resources” in this presentation includes quantities of oil and gas not yet classified as SEC proved oil and gas reserves.&nbsp; Resources are consistent with the Society of Petroleum Engineers 2P and 2C definitions.</p> \n<p>Organic: Our use of the term Organic includes SEC proved oil and gas reserves excluding changes resulting from acquisitions, divestments and year-average pricing impact.</p> \n<p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

      "summary": "The Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc (“RDS”) today announced an interim dividend in respect of the fourth quarter 2012 of US$0.43 per A ordinary share (“A Share”) and B ordinary share (“B Share”), an increase of US$ 0.01on the equivalent US dollar dividend for the same quarter last year.",
      "maintext": "<p>The Board expects that the first quarter 2013 interim dividend will be US$0.45, an increase of 4.7% over the US dollar dividend for the same quarter in the previous year. The first quarter 2013 interim dividend is scheduled to be announced on May 2, 2013.<br /> <br /> RDS provides eligible shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme (“the Programme”). For further details please see below.</p><h2>Details relating to the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group. </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ordinary share</th> \n   <th>Q4 2012</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.43</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.43</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p> \n<p>Cash dividends on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p> \n<p>The pounds sterling and euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on March 8, 2013.<br /> </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ADS</th> \n   <th>Q4 2012</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.86</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.86</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) will be paid, by default, in US dollars.<br /> <br /> ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.<br /> <br /> </p><h2>Scrip Dividend Programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br /> <br /> Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends, if approved by the Board. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br /> <br /> Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.<br /> <br /> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h2>Dividend timetable for the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><br /><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>&nbsp;</th> \n   <th><p>4th quarter 2012</p> </th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Announcement date</th> \n   <td>Jan 31, 2012<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Ex-dividend date</th> \n   <td>Feb 13, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Record date&nbsp;</th> \n   <td>Feb 15, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th> \n   <td>Feb 20, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><i><b>(*)</b></i></sup></th> \n   <td>Mar 1, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</th> \n   <td>Mar 8, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Payment date</th> \n   <td>Mar 28, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i><br /> * A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.<br /> <br /> Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit.

      "title": "Shell Technology Center Houston relaunches after expansion and renovation",
      "summary": "Shell today relaunched Shell Technology Center Houston, which has undergone extensive modernization and expansion to become one of the largest industrial technology centers in the world. ",
      "maintext": "<p>The center is the largest of Shell’s three technology hubs with more than one million square feet of laboratory and office space. It is home to more than 2,000 of Shell’s scientists and engineers including six of the 11 Shell Chief Scientists who are internationally-recognized thoughtleaders in a range of disciplines.. The Houston team collaborates with colleagues worldwide to share knowledge and work efficiently by linking up through 3D virtual reality systems.<br /> <br /> Shell Technology Center Houston is also the global base for a number of specific technology focus areas across upstream and downstream where proficiency, deep knowledge and thought leadership are concentrated.&nbsp; Unique synergies will be sought in the search for innovation solutions to help meet future energy demand.<br /> <br /> “Shell has spent over a billion dollars a year on researching and developing new technologies – more than any of our peers. This investment in innovation and a consistent commitment to collaboration are essential to spark new ideas and develop solutions to today’s and tomorrow’s energy challenges,” said Matthias Bichsel, director of Projects &amp; Technology at Royal Dutch Shell. “They are the keys to delivering much needed energy for a rapidly growing global population and ensuring improved living standards for millions of people now and in the future.”<br /> <br /> Shell works closely with partners in and outside of its industry to come up with new ideas, create new solutions, share knowledge and speed up technology development and deployment. For example, its partnership with an aerospace company leverages the power of fiber optics to deliver more natural gas from tight gas fields, and with another technology company to collaborate on research to extend the life of oil and natural gas fields.<br /> <br /> “Real innovation relies on co-creation, collaborative problem-solving and cultivating next-generation ideas from within and outside our company to pioneer unique solutions,” said Gerald Schotman, Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President, Innovation, Research &amp; Development at Royal Dutch Shell. “Advanced technology solutions continue to generate new energy sources, increase efficiency, and address and responsibly manage environmental impacts.”<br /> <br /> As a result of the refurbishment, about 60 percent of the Houston technology center is new or renovated. The improvements result in a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions and a significant reduction in chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from its operations. Along with receiving a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification, the center reduced energy consumption by approximately $2.0 mln/year.<br /> <br /> Shell Technology Center Houston, along with technology hubs in Bangalore (India) and Amsterdam (The Netherlands), is a key part of Shell’s global network of technology centers and which are connected to Shell’s global businesses, customers and partners. Locations of other Shell research, development and testing facilities currently include Canada, Germany, The Netherlands,&nbsp; Qatar, Norway, the Sultanate of Oman and the UK.&nbsp; A new technical center for lubricants technology is underway in China.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p>For more information please contact Shell Media Relations on +44 207 934 5550.<br /> </p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p><b>Royal Dutch Shell plc</b><br /> Royal Dutch Shell plc is incorporated in England and Wales, has its headquarters in The Hague and is listed on the London, Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges.

      "summary": "The Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc (“RDS”) today announced the Reference Share Price in respect of the third quarter interim dividend of 2012, which was announced on November 1st, 2012 at $0.43 per A ordinary share (“A Share”) and B ordinary share (“B Share”) and $0.86 per American Depository Share (“ADS”).",
      "maintext": "<h2>Reference Share Price</h2><p>The Reference Share price is used for calculating a Participating Shareholder’s entitlement under the Scrip Dividend Programme, as defined below.</p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>Q3 2012</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Reference share price (US$)</td> \n   <td>32.906</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>The Reference Share Price is the US dollar equivalent of the average of the closing price for the Company’s A Shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam for the five dealing days commencing on (and including) the date on which the Shares are first quoted ex-dividend in respect of the relevant dividend.</p> \n<p>The Reference Share Price is calculated by reference to the Euronext Amsterdam closing price in euro. The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.</p><h2>Reference ADS Price</h2><p>ADS stands for “American Depositary Share”. ADR stands for “American Depositary Receipt”. An&nbsp;ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably).&nbsp;ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B.&nbsp;Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>Q3 2012</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Reference ADS price (US$)<br /> </td> \n   <td>65.812</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.&nbsp; A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary. Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.&nbsp; The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs and B ADSs.</p> \n<p>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.&nbsp; Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website: <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\" title=\"www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.</p><h2>Scrip dividend programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme. Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.&nbsp; Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" title=\"www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Shell”) hosted a management day with investors today, focusing on global gas and Asia Pacific Upstream.</p>",
      "maintext": "<p>Outlining Shell’s global gas strategy, CEO Peter Voser said:&nbsp; “Strong growth in gas markets, especially Integrated Gas, is a major opportunity for Shell and our shareholders. Our Integrated Gas earnings have more than trebled in the last five years, reaching $9 billion over the last year, driven by liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and gas-to-liquids (“GTL”), and we see growth opportunities to invest over $20 billion here for 2012-15.”</p> \n<p>“We are aiming to develop profitable new gas supplies to meet the market’s growing demand for clean and affordable low carbon energy. This plays to Shell’s technology and financial strength.”</p> \n<p>Global primary energy demand could double to 400 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Mboe/d”) in the first half of the 21st century, from some 200 Mboe/d in 2000, and 270 Mboe/d in 2011, driven by the non-OECD economies. Some two thirds of energy consumption in 2030 could be in the non-OECD, compared to 56% today.</p> \n<p>Meeting this growth in demand will require large scale and sustained investment in all forms of energy, with an energy mix that is 80% hydrocarbons today, and it will be dominated by hydrocarbons for some time to come.</p> \n<p>Natural gas, which is the cleanest burning fossil fuel,&nbsp;has an important role to play, with more than 250 years of global supply established, and emerging exploration potential, especially in shale gas. Shell expects global natural gas demand to increase by 60% from 2010 to 2030, reaching 25% of the global primary energy mix and within that, strong growth in LNG.</p> \n<p>LNG demand&nbsp;has doubled to 200 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) in the first decade of this century. Shell expects LNG demand&nbsp;to double again to 400 mtpa by 2020, and&nbsp;potentially reach 500 mtpa by 2025. Meeting this demand growth will require substantial industry investment – potentially more than $700 billion – and continued&nbsp;innovation and interdependency between supplier and customer countries.</p> \n<p>Shell is the industry leader in LNG and in gas-to-liquids, and is developing innovative new integrated applications, such as gas-to-chemicals, converting ethane into commercial petrochemicals, and LNG for transport, which offers a lower emission and lower cost alternative to oil fuels.</p> \n<p>Shell has 22 mtpa of LNG on stream today, and is building 7 mtpa of new LNG capacity in Australia that will increase Shell production by 30%. In addition, the company is maturing over 20 mtpa of further LNG options, in Australia, Indonesia and North America, that should drive Shell’s LNG leadership into the next decade.</p> \n<p>For the longer term, Shell has gas-focused exploration programmes in exciting acreage positions such as China, South Africa and Ukraine, which have large scale resources potential, and is assessing over 5 mtpa of LNG to transport opportunities world-wide.</p> \n<p>Voser concluded: “Technological innovation continues to differentiate Shell from our competition and today Shell is the industry leader in LNG, FLNG and GTL.”</p> \n<p>“We are using Shell’s scale and innovation to continue to drive gas growth through integrated value chains. Our portfolio and opportunity set in global gas is unrivalled in the industry today. There is more to come from Shell”.</p><h2>Shell’s integrated gas strategy video comment</h2><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eGv0cCF5DZI?rel=0\"></iframe><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGv0cCF5DZI\">Watch this video on Youtube</a></li></ul><h2>Slides from management day presentations</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/news-and-library/archived-presentations/2012-presentations/asia-pac-roundtable-presentation-15112012.html#subtitle-4\">Slides from management day presentations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/investor/downloads/presentations/2012/asia-pac-roundtablepresentationslides14112012.pdf\">Slides from management day presentations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s07.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/investor/downloads/presentations/2012/asia-pac-roundtablepresentationtranscript15112012.pdf\">Transcript from management day presentations</a></li></ul><h2>Global gas perspectives and Asia Pacific outlook webcast</h2><p>Audio webcast of the Royal Dutch Shell plc management day focusing on Global gas perspectives and Asia Pacific outlook on November 15, 2012 at 10:30 EST/16:30 CET.

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h2>Dividend timetable for the third quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><br /><h2></h2><table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th> &nbsp; </th> \n   <th> <p>3rd&nbsp;quarter 2012</p> </th> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Announcement date </th> \n   <td> November 1, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Ex-dividend date </th> \n   <td> November 14,&nbsp;2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Record date&nbsp; </th> \n   <td> November 16, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Scrip reference share price announcement date </th> \n   <td> November 21, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><em><strong>(*)</strong></em></sup> </th> \n   <td> November 30, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date </th> \n   <td> December 7, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Payment date </th> \n   <td> December 20, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table><em>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders. <br />Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

The acquisition should help to enhance the performance and economic potential from key Shell North Sea operated and non-operated assets, lifting Shell’s production in the Beryl area fields from currently 9 thousand boe/d to 24 thousand boe/d. Shell intends to invest in these assets to substantially extend the production life, for potentially a further 20 years.</p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p>1. Shell is a leading operator in the UK sector of the North Sea and intends to maintain this position. Offshore, Shell has interests in more than 50 fields, operates more than 30 platform installations, 30 subsea installations and one production (FPSO) vessel. Onshore, we operate three gas plants; the St. Fergus Gas Terminal and Fife NGL Plant (with Braefoot Bay marine terminal) in Scotland, and Bacton in the east of England. Shell operates a significant number of its interests in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) on behalf of a 50:50 joint venture with ExxonMobil. The Shell share of UK oil and gas production is about 8% (140 kboe/d in 2011). Almost half of this is gas. This is almost 4% of total Shell Group production.</p> \n<p>2. Shell and Hess Corporation signed an agreement on May 29, 2012 to acquire Hess’s 15.67% interest in the BP operated Schiehallion field. The sale which completed on 28 September 2012 brings Shell’s equity in Schiehallion to 49%.</p> \n<p>3. In 2010 we increased our interest in the Clair field from 18% to 28%. Clair lies west of Shetland and is operated by BP.</p> \n<p>4. The increase in Shell share of fields is as follows: Beryl, Nevis Central, Nevis North, Nevis Far North, Nevis South Cormorant, Loirston, Ness and Ness South from 23% to 45%. Nevis South from 14.8% to 52.2%. On Nevis West Beryl from 0% to 65.5%. On Buckland from 14.4% to 28.5%, and from 15.9% to 25% on Skene.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Media Relations<br /></strong>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550</p> \n<p><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br /></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States – Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong>Cautionary note</strong></p> \n<p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

The Prelude FLNG facility will be deployed in Australian waters over 200 kilometres from the nearest point on the coast.&nbsp; It will produce gas at sea, turn it into liquefied natural gas and then transfer it directly to the ships that will transport it to customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An expert team from Shell will manage the multi-year construction of the FLNG facility to ensure the Prelude project’s critical dimensions of safety, quality, cost and schedule are delivered.&nbsp; Strategic partners Technip and Samsung Heavy Industries (the Technip Samsung Consortium) along with SBM and hundreds of suppliers and contractors around the world are all contributing valuable knowledge, skills and equipment to help make the project a success.&nbsp; At peak levels, around 5,000 people will be working on the construction of the FLNG facility in South Korea; and another 1,000 will build the turret mooring system, subsea and wells equipment in other locations across the globe.</p> \n<p>In the lead up to the facility being ready to start production, a number of actions will take place, such as drilling the production wells, installation of subsea flowlines and risers and mooring chains to prepare for the arrival of the FLNG facility.</p> \n<p>Prelude FLNG is the latest in a line of Shell achievements in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, reinforcing its leadership in technology and innovation.&nbsp; This is the first of what Shell expects to be multiple Shell FLNG projects.</p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p>In 2012, Australian subsidiaries of INPEX Corporation (17.5%) and Korea Gas Corporation (10%) joined the Prelude FLNG project.&nbsp; An Australian subsidiary of CPC Corporation (5%) has also signed an agreement to do so.&nbsp; Completion of this transaction remains subject to conditions including Taiwanese government approval. By taking a stake in the project, INPEX, KOGAS and CPC show the confidence they place in Shell’s FLNG technology.</p> \n<p>FLNG will enable the development of gas resources ranging from clusters of smaller more remote fields to potentially larger fields via multiple facilities where, for a range of reasons, an onshore development is not viable. This can mean faster, cheaper, more flexible development and deployment strategies for resources that were previously uneconomic, or constrained by technical or other risks.</p> \n<p>Many of the technologies used on the FLNG facility are ones that Shell has used successfully onshore, but some have been extended or modified for offshore.&nbsp; The new technologies that Shell developed for FLNG include:&nbsp; managing sloshing in LNG tanks; systems for managing the close coupling between the producing wells and the LNG processing facility; LNG offloading arms; water intake risers;&nbsp; mooring systems; and the marinisation of processing equipment such as absorption columns and the main cryogenic heat exchangers.&nbsp; All of these technologies have been extensively modelled and tested to ensure they can operate safely and efficiently under marine conditions.</p> \n<p>Shell’s innovation in FLNG has been recognised by the industry including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> Lloyd’s List award for Technological Innovation 2012&nbsp; </li> \n <li> CWC / WGI LNG Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Industry 2011 </li> \n</ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://shell.qbank.se/v2.7/mb.php?h=b8bb32c8c976a2b5f4b3450cf4d1a2d4\">Download images from the steel cutting</a></li></ul><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong></p> \n<p>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550<br />Australia: +61 417 007 344</p> \n<p><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br /></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States – Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong>Cautionary note</strong></p> \n<p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

Shell continues to demonstrate the strength and extent of its Arctic preparations.</p>",
      "maintext": "<p>Over the last several days, Shell has successfully completed a series of tests of the first-ever Arctic Containment System. However, during a final test, the containment dome aboard the Arctic Challenger barge was damaged. It is clear that some days will be required to repair and fully assess dome readiness. We are disappointed that the dome has not yet met our stringent acceptance standards; but, as we have said all along, we will not conduct any operation until we are satisfied that we are fully prepared to do it safely. <br /><br />The time required to repair the dome, along with steps we have taken to protect local whaling operations and to ensure the safety of operations from ice floe movement, have led us to revise our plans for the 2012-2013 exploration program. In order to lay a strong foundation for operations in 2013, we will forgo drilling into hydrocarbon zones this year. Instead, we will begin as many wells, known as ‘top holes,’ as time remaining in this season allows. The top portion of the wells drilled in the days and weeks ahead will be safely capped and temporarily abandoned this year, in accordance with regulatory requirements. We look forward to the final receipt of our drilling permits for the multi-year exploration program upon the successful testing and deployment of the Arctic Containment System.<br /><br />These capabilities have, most recently, been evident in Shell’s ice management operations as it successfully moved one of its drill ships and support vessels safely out of the path of approaching sea ice. That drill ship, the Noble Discoverer, is expected to resume its position and drilling operations over the ‘Burger A’ prospect in the days ahead. <br /><br />Also, in the coming days, Shell is expected to begin exploratory drilling in the Beaufort Sea. These operations will follow the conclusion of the fall whale hunt and the anticipated receipt of a top hole drilling permit. <br /><br />We have tested and assembled drill ships and support vessels, trained personnel, and acquired numerous final approved plans and permits. This exploration program remains critically important to America’s energy needs, to the economy and jobs in Alaska, and to Shell.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong><br />International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550 <br /><br /><strong>Shell Investor Relations</strong><br />Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States - Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong><br />Cautionary note </strong><br />The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

The Quest project will be built on behalf of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project joint venture owners (Shell, Chevron and Marathon Oil*) and with support from the Governments of Canada and Alberta.</p>",
      "maintext": "<p>CCS is critical to meeting the huge projected increase in global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, explained Peter Voser, Chief Executive Officer of Royal Dutch Shell plc. “If you want to achieve climate change goals, <a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg1/upstream0/oil-sands/quest/ccs.html\" class=\"shell\">CCS has to be part of the solution</a>. We are helping to advance CCS technology on a number of fronts around the world, but Quest will be our flagship project.”</p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sqkXYKRFkFc?rel=0\"></iframe><p>Alberta’s oil sands are a secure, reliable source of energy and an economic engine which drives employment, training and business development across Canada and beyond.&nbsp; “We will need all sources of energy to meet world demand in the coming decades,” Voser noted.&nbsp; “Lower CO<sub>2</sub> energy sources will grow, but even by 2050 at least 65 per cent of our energy will still come from fossil fuels.&nbsp; So CCS will be important to manage climate impacts.”</p> \n<p>The Athabasca Oil Sands project produces bitumen, which is piped to Shell’s Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton, Alberta.&nbsp; From late 2015, Quest will capture and store deep underground more than one million tonnes a year of CO<sub>2</sub> produced in bitumen processing.&nbsp; Quest will reduce direct emissions from the Scotford Upgrader by up to 35 per cent – the equivalent of taking 175,000 North American cars off the road annually.</p> \n<p>“Quest is another example of how we are using technology and innovation to improve the environmental performance of our oil sands operations,” said Shell Executive Vice President of Heavy Oil, John Abbott. “The opportunity Quest provides to reduce emissions from our upgrading activities is an important achievement in itself, but the project’s technical and strategic value reaches beyond the emissions it will capture.”</p> \n<p>“Quest is important because it is a fully integrated project that will demonstrate existing capture, transportation, injection and storage <a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg1/upstream0/oil-sands/quest/technology.html\" class=\"shell\">technologies</a> working together for the safe and permanent storage of CO<sub>2</sub>. The knowledge it provides will help to enable much wider and more cost-effective application of CCS through the energy industry and other sectors in years to come.”</p> \n<p>Both the Canadian federal and Albertan provincial governments have identified CCS as an important technology in their strategies to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The Alberta government will invest $745 million in Quest from a $2-billion fund to support CCS, while the Government of Canada will invest $120 million through its Clean Energy Fund.</p> \n<p>“We will continue to invest in innovative clean energy technologies such as the Shell Quest project to help support high-quality jobs and responsible development of Canada’s energy resources,” said the Honourable Joe Oliver, Minister of Natural Resources. “Carbon capture and storage has the potential to help us balance our need for energy with our need to protect the environment.”</p> \n<p>“Today’s announcement reaffirms Alberta’s position as a global leader in carbon capture and storage,” said Energy Minister Ken Hughes. “Technologies like CCS will play an instrumental role in helping to lower greenhouse gas intensity from the oil sands and demonstrate to the world Alberta’s commitment to responsible energy development.”</p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fnhz0IUdWg?rel=0\"></iframe><p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls CCS “a crucial part of worldwide efforts to limit global warming” and estimates that it could deliver about one-fifth of necessary worldwide reductions in greenhouse gases by 2050.&nbsp; Shell is also working with governments and experts to help the development of CCS in other countries, including projects in Norway and Australia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Quest is the world’s first commercial-scale CCS project to tackle carbon emissions in the oil sands, and the first CCS project in which Shell will hold majority ownership and act as designer, builder and operator.&nbsp; It will also form the core of Shell’s CCS research programme and help develop Shell’s CO<sub>2</sub> capture technology.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Shell has received the necessary <a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg1/upstream0/oil-sands/quest/consultation.html\" class=\"shell\">federal and provincial regulatory approvals </a>for Quest.&nbsp; Construction has begun and will employ an average of about 400 skilled trades workers over roughly 30 months, peaking at about 700.</p><p><sup><em>* The Athabasca Oil Sands Project, with 255,000 barrels per day of mining and upgrading capacity, is a joint venture among Shell Canada Energy (60 per cent), Chevron Canada Limited (20 per cent) and Marathon Oil Canada Corporation (20 per cent).</em></sup></p> \n<p><sup><br /></sup></p><h2>More about Quest</h2><p>The Quest CCS project will capture more than one million tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> from the Scotford Upgrader located near Edmonton, Alberta and transport it up by an 80 km underground pipeline to a storage site north of the Scotford site. Here, it will inject it more than two kilometres underground into a porous rock formation called the Basal Cambrian Sands (BCS), which is located beneath layers of impermeable rock. Sophisticated monitoring technologies will ensure the CO<sub>2</sub> is permanently stored. In 2011, Quest received the world’s first certificate of fitness for its storage development plan from Det Norske Veritas (DNV), an international risk management firm.&nbsp;DNV assembled a panel of seven <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmjTPzvkJo\" standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" target=\"_blank\">CCS experts from academia and research institutions</a> to perform the review over a two-week period.</p> \n<p>To improve efficiency, up to 50 per cent of project work will be done offsite at a construction yard yet to be selected. Shell will use <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9jwFm9Pbk\" standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" target=\"_blank\">third-party construction facilities</a> in Edmonton, helping the continuing development of key construction capacity in the province.

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /><br />Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /><br />Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br /><br />Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br /><br />For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Shell announces today that it has signed two offshore oil and gas Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with CNOOC, and a PSC amendment with CNPC for a new development phase for the Changbei gas field in China. Shell has also entered an agreement with CNOOC for its participation in two Shell exploration blocks offshore Gabon, West Africa.</p>",
      "maintext": "<p>The two offshore oil and gas PSCs with CNOOC are for blocks 62/02 and 62/17 in the Yinggehai Basin. Shell, as operator, will apply advanced seismic acquisition and processing technologies to conduct 3D seismic data surveys in the Yinggehai blocks. Shell will cover the costs for&nbsp; the acquisition of seismic data and will use advanced drilling technologies to drill exploration wells during the exploration phase. Shell will hold a 100% working interest during the exploration phase, that will be reduced to 49% in any eventual development phase, with CNOOC as majority partner.</p> \n<p>The onshore tight gas PSC amendment with CNPC represents a new phase for the development of the existing Changbei block with 1,692.5 square kilometers in the Ordos Basin, and adds scope to develop additional tight gas sands and further develop the already producing main reservoir. Subject to government approval and pending the outcome of the appraisal campaign, this additional development project could increase the current production plateau of 320mmscf/d. Shell will continue to be the operator at Changbei.</p> \n<p>In Gabon, CNOOC will acquire a 25% participating interest in offshore exploration blocks BC9 and BCD10. CNOOC will reimburse Shell for 25% of certain past exploration costs and carry part of the future exploration costs. Shell will remain operator with 75% interest. The agreement is subject to government approval. Lim Haw-Kuang, Executive Chairman of Shell Companies in China, said: “We are delighted about the return to offshore exploration in China and the opportunity to work with CNOOC again on a major project in the country. We are equally delighted to continue and expand the Changbei success story in partnership with CNPC. Moreover, we are very pleased to have entered the farm-out agreement with CNOOC in Gabon. These new projects in partnership with Chinese companies are the latest showcase of our China strategy to work with our Chinese counterparts both in China and globally to help meet the country’s energy needs to fuel its fast growing economy.”</p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p>Royal Dutch Shell plc is incorporated in England and Wales, has its headquarters in The Hague and is listed on the London, Amsterdam, and New York stock exchanges.

      "summary": "<p>Shell, the current owner of 4.1% of the shares in Gasnor AS, has signed a Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares in the company for USD 74 million (NOK 455.5 million). Subject to Norwegian regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be closed in the 3rd quarter of 2012.</p>",
      "maintext": "<p>Gasnor is a market leader in Norway in small scale LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), supplying LNG as a fuel to industrial and marine customers and operating an end to end supply chain, with three small scale production plants and distribution assets including two tanker ships, a fleet of trucks and a network of terminals. The acquisition of Gasnor is an important step for Shell towards creating an LNG sales business.&nbsp; LNG will be a reliable new addition to Shell’s commercial customers’ fuel mix.</p> \n<p>Colin Abraham, Shell’s Vice President for Downstream LNG, said: “The benefits of natural gas in meeting our future energy needs are well-documented. Shell believes the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in transport sector will develop into a sizeable market and given its industry leading expertise across the LNG value chain, the extension into this market is a good fit for Shell. The Gasnor acquisition provides Shell with invaluable customer and market insight built up over a number of years. This will help us to quickly develop and meet customer requirements for LNG as a transport fuel.”</p> \n<p>Through this acquisition, Shell will capitalise on Gasnor’s experience in LNG sales and marketing, combining it with its own customer reach to target European marine customers ahead of new environmental regulations that will come into force from 2015.&nbsp; These regulations will apply across the Baltic Sea, English Channel and North Sea and will require lower levels of ‘air-quality emissions’ such as sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Switching to LNG can help to reduce these emissions.&nbsp; Shell expects European marine LNG to be a key growth sector as customers look for cleaner, cost competitive fuel alternatives as part of their fuel supply mix.</p> \n<p>Eilef Stange, Gasnor’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “Shell’s customer reach and Gasnor’s LNG sales and marketing experience is a winning combination.&nbsp; There is real growth potential for small scale LNG in Europe, particularly in the marine sector, and Gasnor with Shell is well placed to capitalise on this.”</p> \n<p>LNG as a marine fuel is not new. LNG has been used to power gas engines in LNG carriers for many years. Shell has been a pioneer in this area, and has an excellent track record in terms of the safe storage, handling and movement of LNG.</p> \n<p>In September 2011 Shell took its first final investment decision on a LNG for transport project in Canada to supply LNG to Shell Flying J truck stops for use by heavy truck fleets. In June 2012, Shell signed a memorandum of understanding with TravelCenters of America LLC (TA) to sell LNG to heavy-duty road transport customers in the US through TA’s existing nationwide network of full-service fueling centers.</p><h2>Note to editors</h2><ul> \n <li> Shell is a global leader in upstream LNG and helped pioneer the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, providing the technology for the world's first commercial liquefaction plant in 1964. Shell is a participant in nine operating LNG projects with some 21.5 million tonnes per annum operational LNG capacity, in seven countries. It has three new projects under construction with 15 mtpa of LNG options. Shell was a partner in the first-ever purpose built LNG carrier and has been delivering LNG safely for nearly half a century. Today Shell is the world’s largest LNG shipping operator, with interests in around a quarter of the LNG vessels in operation. </li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li> Norway was one of the first European countries to focus on LNG as a fuel and this forward thinking helped foster Gasnor’s pioneering approach.&nbsp; Shell already has an upstream and downstream presence in Norway and this LNG acquisition is part of Norske Shell’s growth ambitions. </li> \n</ul><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br /></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States – Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p> \n<p><strong>Shell Media Relations<br /></strong>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550</p><p><strong>Cautionary note</strong></p> \n<p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.
