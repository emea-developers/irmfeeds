          "maintext": "<p><i>A defining characteristic of the “tight” rock formations that are increasingly being tapped for natural gas in the USA and – tentatively – elsewhere is the heterogeneity of their geology. This variability is compounded by uncertainty regarding their in-situ stresses. For this reason, says Matthias Bichsel, Projects &amp; Technology Director, almost nothing definitive can be stated about an untested tight gas resource until a lot of exploration data have first been collected and analysed. This a priori unpredictability of how a tight gas field will be developed – if it is developed at all – also calls for increased flexibility in planning and execution. And outside of North America, it requires increased flexibility in production-sharing contracts. A bigger technological toolbox is needed too, so that operators can better deal with the wide array of geological and non-geological variables.</i></p><img src=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/matthias-bichsel240.jpg\" alt=\"Matthias Bichsel\"/><h2>Not all fields are created equal</h2><p>Good morning everyone.</p> \n<p>I’m pleased to join this executive session on the global gas challenge, because Shell sees natural gas as increasingly crucial to meeting the world's energy needs.</p> \n<p>We also believe it is imperative to make the most of all the gas resources available, both conventional and unconventional.</p> \n<p>Today I want to touch on some of the inherent challenges of developing unconventional gas resources: first, in terms of geological factors; then non-geological factors. Along the way, I will highlight how unconventional resources differ from conventional ones – especially in terms of the predictability of their production potential and ultimate recovery.</p> \n<p>That difference is crucial. It explains why, when you’re considering the development of shale gas resources, a lot more information and a more flexible mindset is needed.</p><h2>Geological variability & uncertainty</h2><p>First, a word about terminology. I’m using the term “tight gas fields” to refer to fields that produce natural gas from formations consisting of ultra-tight sandstones, carbonates, shales and coals, and where the gas is not confined by a conventional trap of a structural or stratigraphic nature.</p> \n<p>Having cleared that up, let’s now consider what’s so special about them.</p> \n<p>The first geological factor to consider with tight gas fields is their lithology. These fields vary widely in their rock properties – much more so than conventional fields.</p> \n<p>Some rock formations are clayey and thus, at certain temperatures, ductile. Others are brittle, making them easier to crack. Some have no pre-existing fractures, but some do. And these pre-existing cracks can contribute to well productivity…unless they don’t.</p> \n<p>There’s no way of knowing what type of rock formation you’re dealing with until you actually drill and production-test the formation.</p> \n<p>These lithological properties – and their implications for well completions – are difficult to predict at the exploration stage, but they can drastically affect field development plans. And what’s more: they can vary even from one well to the next in the same formation!</p> \n<p>A second important factor is the geomechanics of these formations. There is a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude and orientation of principal in-situ stress axes around a well. This can make it difficult to get hydraulic fractures to grow in exactly the way you want.</p> \n<p>Conversely, the more you understand the geomechanical stresses, the better you can get them to work in your favour – perhaps even reducing the needed scale of hydraulic fracturing.</p><h2>Gathering & assessing facts</h2><p>All this variability and uncertainty means that, before one can decide whether a shale play is worth developing or not, one needs to collect and analyse a lot of appraisal data. Usually, a few good 2D seismic lines are required to understand the basic tectonic framework and layout, perhaps with a few limited 3D seismic surveys where more complicated structures are expected.</p> \n<p>Then a dozen or so wells need to be drilled, logged and tested. And it's not just a short production test as it generally is for conventional gas plays.</p> \n<p>Longer production tests are necessary, because unconventionals are exactly that: unconventional. The traditional approach won’t do; they need a more in-depth approach for an operator to get a good idea of the ultimate recovery per well and the likely production profile. Both data are crucial since they determine the economic viability of these challenging plays.</p> \n<p>So it’s quite crucial to ensure geoscientists and petroleum engineers have enough time to take a good, thorough look at the situation under the ground.</p> \n<p>This can try the patience of people who want immediate yes/no answers: the investors who are putting their money on the line, for example…or the communities who feel that their way of life may be threatened. But there’s no other way to avoid false expectation other than through a thorough exploration and appraisal campaign.</p> \n<p>That’s why I don’t like all the hype about the potential – good or bad – of untested tight gas plays. We first need to collect all the facts and soberly assess them before we can reasonably talk about their commercial potential.</p><h2>If you don’t succeed…</h2><p>Yes, there have been some great success stories in producing gas from shale formations, with some big ones such as the Bakken, the Barnett, the Eagle Ford, the Bossier-Haynesville in the US or the Montney in Canada.</p> \n<p>But let’s not forget that there have been a fair number of disappointments too. We don’t hear much about them.</p> \n<p>In the US states of Wyoming and Utah, for instance, the industry could not get the Green River basin to really work. And I’m afraid that some countries may be setting themselves up for dashed expectations. Take Poland, for instance, where a number of operators have announced that they're pulling out.</p> \n<p>Getting definitive results requires tenacity, but tenacity driven by a good understanding of the petroleum geology. Only production geologists can know where the rocks are favourable and therefore where persistence is warranted.</p><h2>Non-geological factors</h2><p>The geological factors I’ve mentioned make tight gas plays quite different from traditional gas fields. But there are several non-geological factors that also call for an approach to field development that’s different from what we’re used to in conventional fields.</p> \n<p>For Shell, a tight field development is largely about safe manufacturing techniques with mass-production-like drivers: speed, cost control, streamlining. But unlike product manufacturing, where feedstocks are quality controlled for uniformity, we have to deal with what Mother Nature gives us – and she can surprise us.</p> \n<p>Nor should we dismiss the possible impacts such developments have on local land, water and air. Or the dust, noise and road accidents that heavy-goods traffic can cause.</p> \n<p>Clearly, it will take a bigger technological tool box to enable operators to deal with both geological and non-geological factors. But before I describe some tools that can help, I’d like to stress again what these factors lead to in practice: unpredictability – much more so than in conventional developments.</p><h2>Who knows?</h2><p>So it’s very difficult to say with certainty how – or even if – an undeveloped shale gas play can realistically be successfully developed.</p> \n<p>And that’s why it’s so important that high expectations be kept in check.</p> \n<p>A recent report by the Institute of Directors called UK shale gas a 'new North Sea'. But this is premature: the geology still needs to be investigated.</p> \n<p>Let me remind you that the Alum shale in Sweden was described as 'one of the thickest and richest marine source rocks in onshore northern Europe'. Yet Shell’s exploration wells revealed it to have only low gas saturation.</p> \n<p>Equally, a blanket moratorium on exploration seems rash if the underlying geology has not been investigated – as, for example, in Romania, France and elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Hence my underlying point: the need for greater flexibility to assess the geology properly, to avoid both overblown optimism and ungrounded pessimism.</p> \n<p>That’s why I was gladdened by EU Commissioner G&uuml;nther Oettinger’s recent statement. He wants Germany not to completely reject hydraulic fracturing, but instead create an appropriate regulatory structure – one that will enable the country at least to allow exploratory drilling. Subsequent decisions will then be “smarter” and based on a better understanding of the costs – and benefits – of a field development.</p> \n<p>Greater flexibility in planning and execution is also needed – particularly where production-sharing contracts apply. A development plan for an unconventional field needs to give the operator the opportunity to adapt the plan according to the geological realities as and when they become apparent. The production-sharing contractor must be able to adapt a field development plan on the fly. Regulations need to allow this.</p><h2>A key ratio</h2><p>Where greater flexibility in exploration and development has been achieved, there are several tools that can help to deliver good outcomes. From an operator’s point of view, the outcomes can be measured in terms of a key ratio: productivity over cost.</p> \n<p>One way to increase well productivity without appreciably increasing costs is to make sure that the hydraulic fractures work as intended. We’ve discovered that about a quarter of ours are ineffective: they don’t really contribute to a well’s production.</p> \n<p>By modelling fracture mechanics better, we can understand how multiple hydraulically induced fractures will grow and interact with one other in heterogeneous formations. Shell has been studying this using advanced numerical models. The model is able to capture the influence of key parameters such as fluid-injection rate, fracture spacing and formation properties. We’re currently working to extend the model to gain insight into the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures.</p> \n<p>And that leads me to another productivity-enhancing technique: what we call “domain stimulation”.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the prevailing stress field occasionally enables one to enlist the help of pre-existing fractures. These natural fractures are normally shut tight, but the ones near a wellbore can – under the right in-situ stress and injection conditions – be forced open during hydraulic stimulation operations. In such a case, the planes on either side of the fracture shift ever so slightly with respect to each other. When the hydraulic pressure is relieved, the planes no longer fit together perfectly. The result is a flow path for gas. In Canada, we’ve used domain stimulation in openhole completions to successfully increase well productivity.</p><h2>Automation & standardisation</h2><p>Now let’s look at the denominator in our key ratio. How can we decrease the cost per well?</p> \n<p>Tight and shale gas fields require hundreds or even thousands of wells to extract the gas. Our industry simply doesn't have the manpower to handle that increase in activity. So we need more automation in drilling, completing and operating wells.</p> \n<p>That’s why Shell developed the SCADAdrill autonomous control system, for instance. It connects to the existing instruments and controls of a drilling rig, operating the rig machinery and monitoring all aspects of the well-making process. Letting a machine handle the mechanical and hydraulic drudgery means that the driller can focus on things that require more thought and care – safety, for one.</p> \n<p>The driller at the rig site is always in control, though. And he can intevene at any time if necessary.</p> \n<p>SCADAdrill also enables expert directional drillers and well engineers at a real-time operating centre to monitor the rig remotely. They can adjust the control settings as required. Using such real-time operating centres, one directional driller can monitor several wells at once rather than just one at a time.</p> \n<p>More standardisation is also needed in drilling and completing wells – the kind of approach that Shell is pursuing in a well-manufacturing joint venture with the China National Petroleum Corporation. We’re pursuing a 'conveyor belt' approach in which standard pieces of equipment carry out different stages in the drilling and completion process. In this way several wells can be worked on in parallel, rather than having one customised drilling rig working on one well at a time.</p> \n<p>Finally, both productivity and cost can be optimised with better well monitoring – which Shell is addressing by integrating fibre optics with existing monitoring equipment.</p> \n<p>An optic fibre can act as one continuous thermometer capable of measuring temperature anywhere along its length. Such distributed temperature sensing – or DTS – has become a well-established technique for monitoring wellbore activity, such as hydraulic fracturing. To this end, a fibre-optic cable is clamped on the outside of the production casing, and data are recorded and visualised as the treatment is carried out.</p> \n<p>Recently, we’ve begun to deploy cables containing two optic fibres – one for thermal sensing and one for acoustic sensing, to pick up the sounds of fluids flowing. With this arrangement, we get immediate readings of how the treatment is progressing and can derive a better description of the actual result.</p><h2>Tools for non-technical challenges</h2><p>Shell is working just as hard on solutions to the non-technical challenges. One of these is reducing the environmental footprint of tight-gas activities.</p> \n<p>Advanced water management practices are making a significant difference here. Through reuse and disposal practices, we’re able to reduce water consumption in drilling. At the Groundbirch gas field in Canada and the Pinedale gas field in the US we reuse gas-processing water for hydraulic fracturing. This reduces our freshwater requirements significantly – by as much as 50% or more.</p> \n<p>And wherever possible, we use non-potable water for drilling and completion fluids. At Groundbirch, we’re using sewage water – treated, of course – from the neighbouring city of Dawson Creek. In fact, the combination of reusing frack water and topping up with treated waste water means that we won’t need any fresh water at all in our operations there.</p> \n<p>A while ago, we published the Shell Operating Principles for tight sand and shale oil and gas operations. This is not so much a tool as it is a handbook, but we nonetheless keep it in our field-development toolbox.</p> \n<p>The principles are specifically designed to protect water, land, air and communities. For us, adhering to them is an important part of building trust locally, nationally and internationally.</p> \n<p>And we’re constantly looking for other opportunities to raise the standards for the industry. The Marcellus play is a good example. We’ve formed a coalition there with several operators who are willing to give audit rights to an independent third party. We hope to see more initiatives like this. They might set the bar high enough to meet the public’s and government’s expectations and to weed out irresponsible operators.</p><h2>To wrap up…</h2><p>Let me end by emphasising three points:</p> \n<p>First, natural gas is at the heart of a sustainable energy future, and we need to make responsible use of all possible sources, conventional and unconventional.</p> \n<p>Second, with unconventional plays, it is not possible to know the cost and benefits of a field development without due diligence – and that requires exploration and appraisal wells. If the results are favourable, then flexibility for planning and execution is also required in production-sharing contracts and regulatory regimes.</p> \n<p>Third, innovation – in both technical and non-technical areas – holds the key to lowering costs and increasing benefits. I’ve mentioned a few new technologies today, but there are many more that should be developed.</p> \n<p>The good news is: the current pace and quality of innovation make me optimistic that natural gas from unconventional sources can help to keep the lights on and people and goods on the move – and to do it ever more sustainably.</p> \n<p>Thank you.</p>",

This refinery imported 68 million barrels of Maya and Olmeca crude from Mexico in 2011, and sent back 17 million barrels of refined product in return.</p> \n<p>I very much look forward to the possibility of exploring other partnering opportunities with Pemex in the months and years to come.</p> \n<p>I’m also proud to say our team in Mexico – led by Alberto de la Fuente – is staffed 100% with Mexican talent. </p> \n<p>We’ve opened a sourcing office here in Mexico. It’s one of only four Shell sourcing offices in the world, set up to certify suppliers to meet our global demand for skills, products and services.&nbsp; The suppliers we’re developing here will be critical sources of local content for any future investment by private investors in Mexico.</p> \n<p>This is a vibrant nation with enormous potential. The OECD describes this as “Mexico’s moment”. </p> \n<p>I’d like to think of it not just Mexico’s moment, but as Mexico’s era.</p><h2>The reality of a changing world</h2><p>One way to think of the recipe for any country – to manage the risks and capture the opportunities of the coming decades is in terms of three key ingredients: investment, innovation, and imagination.</p> \n<p>And it’s that future I’d like to offer a few thoughts on today.&nbsp; But first, a bit of context…</p> \n<p>I’m prepared to make very few confident predictions in life.&nbsp; But one is inescapable: the number of people in the world will grow. </p> \n<p>Dramatically. By 2050 our children will share this planet with more than 9 billion people.&nbsp; Every day the world is home to nearly 200,000 more people.&nbsp; Every week for the next 30 years the world will add the equivalent of a city the size of Le&oacute;n.</p> \n<p>That means more demand for the essentials of life: food, water, energy – resources that are already stressed today. </p> \n<p>And beyond the essentials, roughly a billion people in developing parts of the world are entering the market for the cars, washing machines, refrigerators and computers they see in the developed world. </p> \n<p>All of this growing demand for our resources is happening on a planet that’s not getting any bigger.</p> \n<p>How society will deal with this tension between growth and resources – the “stress nexus” as we call it – is anybody’s guess: It depends on how national and regional policies will evolve, how markets will respond, how technologies will develop, how consumers will behave.</p><h2>Looking ahead: Shell’s New Lens Scenarios</h2><p>But companies like Shell don’t like to leave questions like this purely to guesswork.&nbsp; So for the last 40 years, we have developed scenarios to help us plan for the future. We use scenarios to improve our understanding of global trends – economic trends, political trends, social trends, environmental trends. </p> \n<p>And we examine what those trends could mean for the energy system. Scenarios help us think more strategically by giving us a better sense of challenges and opportunities that could lie just over the horizon. </p> \n<p>Our most recent scenario work, published just this year, produced two divergent views of how the future could unfold. On your chairs today, you found a card with a link to the scenarios website. There, you will find the work on scenarios available for download. Printed copies are also available at our expo booth. </p> \n<p>In one of these scenarios, political and economic power structures around the world remain relatively static. Central governments maintain tight control over policies and planning. There is not a lot of economic mobility, innovation, or growth. But there is stability and, ironically, a more co-ordinated global effort to reduce greenhouse emissions. </p> \n<p>That’s because of policies to tap abundant natural gas reserves combined with large- scale public investment in carbon capture and storage projects.</p> \n<p>In the other scenario, dynamic and diffuse market and political forces dominate. The economy grows for everyone, but in turbulent, uncontrolled ways that make coordinated policies on energy and climate more difficult.</p> \n<p>Demand for energy – any energy – skyrockets. Growth in the use of cheap, available, but dirty coal continues. Only later, around mid-century, does the climate crisis finally force a dramatic shift into alternative energies, like solar.</p> \n<p>That’s the 60-second version of a scenarios discussion that our experts could spend hours detailing. We will be hosting a presentation on the Shell Scenarios in Mexico City on July 9, and we’d love for you to join us then for an opportunity to go into much more detail.</p> \n<p>But for now, I hope this summary offers a glimpse at how corporations, industry associations, NGOs, media, think tanks, national governments – for that matter, all of us in this room – need to be thinking about the future.</p> \n<p>And there are few countries with as much of a stake in that future as Mexico.</p><h2>The Mexico era</h2><p>Mexico is among the ten largest oil producers in the world. This country has made important structural changes to improve economic performance and strengthen its resilience to external shocks.&nbsp; It is a strong partner to the United States and to Canada. </p> \n<p>I spoke earlier about the opportunity for a Mexico “era” and the three key ingredients in a recipe for any country’s success: investment, innovation and imagination.</p> \n<p>Investment is the obvious one.</p> \n<p>Shell alone invests more than $30 billion every year to meet the growing demand for energy.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>The energy industry globally will spend untold trillions over the next four decades to find, develop and produce ever more challenging sources of energy – from traditional oil and gas, to shale gas, to liquids from shales, to advanced biofuels, hydrogen, wind and solar.</p> \n<p>Mexico is jostling with countries around the world for a share of that capital. In this hemisphere alone, it joins a fierce competition for capital with Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, French Guiana, Argentina and others.</p> \n<p>Of course, Mexico already has some competitive advantages through free trade agreements, its strategic location, competitive exchange rate, labor costs and quality manufacturing. </p> \n<p>But its advantage will only increase as it attracts more investment with stable and attractive fiscal and regulatory frameworks.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>A recent World Bank study suggests Mexico needs the equivalent of around five or six additional Pemexes over the next 10 to 15 years to leverage even just its potential deep-water resources. </p> \n<p>The study says investment in deep-water delivers 1.6 times its value in terms of expansion of the supply base, labor development and supporting services. For onshore investments – including unconventional, complex, capital intensive basins – the factor is around 1.4. </p> \n<p>Analysis we’ve commissioned suggests attracting more capital into the energy sector could increase Mexico’s economic growth rate by as much as 5 or 6 percentage points.</p> \n<p>And beyond economic growth, we have seen – in countries ranging from Norway to Malaysia – what else happens when countries earn investment in the energy sector: technology booms, an increase in specialised, high paying jobs, transfer of knowledge into and across the economy, higher industrial safety standards, new levels of transparency and trust in government. </p> \n<p>The potential benefits for Mexico could extend even further, fuelling Mexico’s continuing progress in the fight against poverty and inequality, its desire to protect its environment, its potential to be a regional manufacturing powerhouse -- in short, to realising “Mexico’s era”.</p> \n<p>But return on investment will go only so far without innovation to go with it.</p> \n<p>The race is on to create new techniques to find, produce and commercialise more -- and more difficult -- sources of energy: energy locked in shale, in sand, under ice, in ultra-deep waters.</p> \n<p>But it’s just as important to look at innovation in how companies, governments and societies work together. </p> \n<p>As a global company, with partnerships in almost every corner of the world, Shell has the ability – I’d even say the obligation – to join up imaginative ideas across boundaries -- intellectual and political boundaries as well as geographic boundaries.</p> \n<p>Let me use our experience with China as one example. China is focused on developing a safer, cleaner, secure energy future that can fuel their economic growth and support the needs of nearly a quarter of the world’s people. </p> \n<p>China knows that will require a team effort.&nbsp; It has reached out in innovative ways to build relationships with global energy companies. So we are developing tight gas resources with China National Petroleum Corporation, helping to expand supplies of this cleaner-burning fuel. Together we are exploring for gas in the Sichuan Province and working on a coal-bed methane project in the Shanxi Province. </p> \n<p>At the same time, CNPC is also an equity partner in our Groundbirch gas project in Canada. China gets access to Canada’s surplus of energy, CNPC gets access to international technology and growth opportunities, Canada gets access to a vital energy market, and we create value for our shareholders. </p> \n<p>By working with China and its energy companies on international projects, we not only create new investment opportunities, but also promote a global energy infrastructure based on shared best practices and smart technologies. Everyone wins.</p> \n<p>And there are dozens of other innovative examples with countries and national energy companies around the world. I see a huge opportunity for Mexico and Pemex to lengthen the list of examples, working with IOCs and other governments to be part of the solution to our future energy challenge.</p> \n<p>Which brings me to the role of imagination.</p> \n<p>Imagination in this context simply means thinking creatively about what the future scenarios might bring to Mexico. Risks?&nbsp; Opportunities? Or both? Will Mexico find itself chasing solutions to the energy challenge? Or will it lead those solutions? </p> \n<p>I’m imagining a Mexico that will help lead.</p> \n<p>I can see a Mexico that attracts international investment with a sophisticated domestic industry, a network of international partnerships, a talented, skilled and highly-developed workforce, a commitment to a sustainable and efficient energy system.</p> \n<p>It’s not hard – with a little imagination – to see at least a few broad actions that all of us – in public and private roles – can take now to get us firmly on the road toward a more sustainable energy system.</p> \n<p>For example, taking advantage of the world’s 250-year supply of natural gas resources to reduce coal consumption. </p> \n<p>Natural gas should play a major role in fostering a cleaner and more sustainable energy system.&nbsp; It’s clean, it’s abundant, and it can be deployed for everything from electrical power to home use to transport. There is so much of it now available in North America that this continent could become a net exporter of energy in just a few decades.</p> \n<p>As a source of electrical power, natural gas produces about half the CO<sub>2 &nbsp;</sub>emissions of coal. The shale gas revolution in the USA has already reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there more than anyone could have predicted just a few years ago.</p> \n<p>Natural gas is also a natural ally to renewables. Solar power and wind need a back-up because they are intermittent sources. Gas-fired power can keep the electricity flowing when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, in part because gas-fired power plants can be turned on and off quickly. </p> \n<p>Another example of imaginative leadership lies in promoting smarter urban planning to reduce energy demand, especially in transportation. </p> \n<p>Intelligent urban planning could transform the entire global transport system over the next 50 years. It can do so by providing an infrastructure for vehicles increasingly powered by electricity, hydrogen and natural gas. </p> \n<p>And more efficient, more sustainable, more livable cities deliver benefits beyond just reducing demand for energy. They are healthier, safer, more attractive to talented workers and more equitable.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A policy climate that attracts investment -- far-sighted government actions based on innovative public-private innovation -- a view of the future inspired by creative imagination. </p> \n<p>These are the ingredients for leadership as I see it. These are my modest contributions to the vital conversations you have been&nbsp; having here this week.</p> \n<p>Thank you very much again for the opportunity to share them.</p>",

          "summary": "Speech given by Andy Brown, Upstream International Director, Royal Dutch Shell plc, at the Nor Shipping Offshore Conference in Oslo, Norway on June 5, 2013. ",
          "maintext": "<p><i>In the last 100 years the oil and gas industry and the shipping industry have sustained a strong relationship in conquering new frontiers to bring the world the energy it needs. Now, as technologies develop and the demand for energy increases, both industries face the challenge of exploring new areas to unlock new resources. In this keynote speech to the Nor Shipping Offshore Conference in Norway, Andy Brown stresses the important role the maritime industry plays within the oil and gas industry and the progress that has been made. He also discusses Shell’s interests in exploring new locations such as the Arctic. Continuous innovation is key in how we operate and both industries can provide value in deliverying new energy resources.</i></p><img src=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/gbr/images-text/imgs/240x178/andy-brown.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Brown\"/><h2>Conquering new frontiers together</h2><p>It’s an honour for me to be here with you and speak about New Frontiers.</p> \n<p>I also want to reflect on the close relationship and interdependency that exist between the oil and gas industry and the shipping industry.</p> \n<p>Together, the oil and gas industry and the shipping industry bring energy to the world. Both industries have been pushing the boundaries for over a century in a quest to find, produce and deliver ever more energy to customers around the globe.</p> \n<p>To meet the growing demand for energy, there will be a need to substantially increase investment levels and push innovation even further.</p> \n<p>Shell’s maritime heritage dates back 120 years. Our long history is marked by many firsts:</p> \n<p>The Murex, Shell’s first bulk tanker, set sail in 1892 and its journey through the Suez Canal achieved a revolution in oil transportation.</p> \n<p>Shell was an early pioneer in LNG shipping, starting over 50 years ago, with LNG being delivered to the UK on the SS Methane Princess in 1964.</p> \n<p>We have come a long way since then. Today, shipping is a very significant part of Shell’s business. We are involved in over 100,000 cargo transfers a year and Shell Shipping &amp; Maritime manages and operates 44 LNG ships, making us the single largest LNG ship operator in the world.</p> \n<p>And we continue to develop new technologies aimed at improving our daily operations and unlocking more energy resources.</p> \n<p>The relationship between our industries has evolved significantly over the last 100 years.</p> \n<p>The maritime expertise in our industries has played an important role in unlocking new energy resources.&nbsp; From the initial need to move products around the world, we are now integrated in the whole offshore value chain.</p> \n<p>From exploring for new resources to daily support to offshore platforms, we now operate drilling rigs, support vessels, tugs, oil tankers, Floating Production and Storage Offtake (FPSOs), Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRUs), LNG carriers.</p> \n<p>On any one day, Shell has an interest in around 1,500 of the ships and barges sailing the world’s oceans and rivers. And we are proud to say that we manage our fleet well: in 2012 our reliability was a remarkable 99.6%.</p> \n<p>Since the late 40’s, when the first commercially viable offshore oil well was drilled in the Gulf of Mexico, the oil and gas industry has continuously pushed the boundaries into ever more challenging offshore locations. The maritime expertise in the industry has played a key role in this process.</p> \n<p>In the 70’s and 80’s, the North Sea proved to be a challenging new frontier given its tough weather conditions.</p> \n<p>Here in Norway, Troll was declared commercial in the 80’s and is a remarkable offshore milestone. Troll A remains the biggest concrete platform offshore anywhere in the world and it is the tallest structure ever moved over the surface of the Earth by human beings with its 472 meters. Shell was the field developer and our partner Statoil is the field’s producing operator.</p> \n<p>Much of the conventional oil and gas exploration and production will continue to expand to offshore areas, deeper waters and more remote and challenging locations.</p> \n<p>Greater integration between the energy and shipping industries will continue to be needed to allow us to continue to conquer new physical, operational and innovation frontiers.</p> \n<p>Of the remaining 2.7 trillion barrels of recoverable conventional oil resources in the world, the IEA estimates 45% is in offshore fields – and 25% of them are in water more than 400 meters deep.<br /> </p> \n<p>The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities and excitement to bring these projects onstream.</p> \n<p>Ormen Lange, considered as Norway’s first genuine deepwater development, continues to be the deepest producing field in Europe – in water depths up to 1,100 meters. In Ormen Lange, Norsk Hydrol was the operator during the development phase and we took operatorship in 2007. All offshore installations were installed on the ocean floor, under extreme weather conditions and sub-zero water temperatures at the seabed.</p> \n<p>The gas is brought onshore for processing; and it is then exported to the UK. I know the Norwegians like to say that every fifth cup of tea in England is heated by the help of gas from Ormen Lange.But, when it comes to deepwater, we are going ever deeper; and since the first FPSO used in the 70’s our industries have been working together in developing new technologies and improving the designs to meet the challenges we face.</p> \n<p>In the Gulf of Mexico we have taken Final Investment Decision in Project Stones. It will host the deepest production facility in the world at 2,896 metres (9,500 feet). It is Shell's first FPSO in the Gulf of Mexico and it will integrate a disconnectable turret, which will allow the FPSO to be unplugged from the well system and sail to safe areas in case of adverse weather conditions during the hurricane season for example.</p> \n<p>In Malaysia, the Gumusut-Kakap Development will employ the region’s first deepwater Floating Production System (FPS) with a processing capacity of 150,000 b/d and an expected production at peak of 135,000 b/d. Blue Marlin, the FPS load-out vessel, took the FPS to the offshore location last week.</p> \n<p>In exploration, to conduct our drilling activities in West Africa later this year, for example, we will use the Noble Globetrotter II, which is currently in sea trials.</p> \n<p>We look at the rig and it looks more like a ship than a drilling rig. From the early design phases, the aim was to merge shipping technology with drilling requirements.</p> \n<p>It is extraordinary the ability of our industries in keeping a rig like this on station with its dynamic positioning capability, even in adverse weather conditions. The rig is able to drill in over 3,000 meters of water, face 52 feet waves, 100 knots winds and 3.5 knots currents. It has a multi-purpose tower designed to maximise productivity and safety, is more energy efficient, uses less fuel and is shorter and lighter than other deep water drillships with similar capacity. In addition, it allows the crane decks to be removed, allowing it to pass through places as the Panama and Suez Canals, expanding the areas in which it can operate.</p> \n<p>We can’t talk about new frontiers without mentioning the Arctic. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Arctic could hold 14% of the oil and over 25% of the gas of the world’s yet-to-be discovered resources.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We are not new to the Arctic. The oil and gas industry has a long history of successful operations throughout the offshore Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. And we fully acknowledge the the challenges that come with development in such a remote and environmentally-sensitive area.</p> \n<p>In Alaska, we drilled multiple wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the 1980s and 1990s. We also drilled at the Bering Sea, St. George Basin, Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet – where Shell installed the first platforms in challenging conditions. Those platforms are still producing today.</p> \n<p>Shell remains committed to building an Arctic exploration program including Alaska. We continue to believe that a measured and responsible pace, especially in the exploration phase, fits best in this remote area.</p> \n<p>We have certainly taken the Kulluk incident very seriously and we reassessed our plans for 2013. Future exploration plans for offshore Alaska will depend on a number of factors, including the readiness of our rigs and our confidence that lessons learned from our 2012 drilling program have been fully incorporated.</p> \n<p>But we cannot ignore all the developed and deployed operational capabilities to support a multi-year, multi-well offshore drilling programme. We had two rigs operating in the area, both for primary drilling purposes and in the unlikely event a relief well is needed.</p> \n<p>Double shear rams on BOPs, a capping stack, an unique Arctic viable containment system and more than 20 marine vessels in place to provide logistics support and oil spill response if needed, with response capability inside one hour for both rigs, with approved capacity to clean up a spill greater than any envisioned worst case scenario discharge, using a combination of mechanical skimming, dispersants, and in situ burning.</p> \n<p>We have not taken a decision to drill in 2014. There are some activities that must take place this year in order to preserve the option to drill in 2014, including filing appropriate permits and plans with relevant regulators as well as engaging local communities and contractors. These activities should not be taken for a final decision to drill.</p> \n<p>As we continue to move to more challenging and remote areas, we also have to be innovative on how we respond to potential incidents in our operations.</p> \n<p>Following the Macondo incident we are taking this even more seriously.&nbsp; In 2011, nine international oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project, with the aim of analysing, developing and deploying mechanisms to improve the industry’s response to deepwater subsea well incidents.</p> \n<p>It is a non-profit joint initiative between BG, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Petrobras, Shell, Statoil and Total.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year SWRP delivered integrated intervention systems that include four capping stack toolboxes and two hardware kits for subsea application of dispersant at wellhead.</p> \n<p>SWRP collaborated with the Oil Spill Response Ltd (OSRL) to make this integrated intervention system available to the industry in the event of a subsea well incident. The first intervention system, with a capping stack and hardware kit, is now available for international use from OSRL’s Base in Norway. A further three capping devices and another hardware kit will be delivered before the end of Q3 2013 to the other three locations of the project: Brazil, South Africa and Singapore.</p> \n<p>We have just entered the third phase of the project, where we will develop a containment toolkit that can support subsea well incident if well shut-in is not immediately possible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Technology development has also been essential to unlock new energy resources and move those resources around the globe. In addition to the innovative approaches seen in deepwater projects, I believe we are seeing unparalleled and exciting innovation in our industry creating new sources of supply and demand for LNG.</p> \n<p>We are pioneering with the groundbreaking Prelude FLNG technology. We cut the steel in 2012 and plan to start-up the largest floating offshore facility ever built around 2017. At 488 meters long, it is approximately the length of a par 5 hole on a golf course. When fully equipped and with its storage tanks full, it will weigh around 600,000 tonnes – roughly six times as much as the largest aircraft carrier. It has been designed to withstand severe weather and will stay moored even during a Category 5 cyclone. The Prelude Project is well underway, with construction occurring at various locations around the world.</p> \n<p>But we are also innovating in LNG demand. We see tremendous growth potential for LNG as a transport fuel, especially in the marine segment.</p> \n<p>Norway was one of the first European nations to focus on this. There are about 34 vessels in Norway operating LNG today. More than a third of the current LNG fuelled vessels in Norway are Platform Support Vessels</p> \n<p>Here Shell acquired Gasnor, a market leader in supplying LNG to industrial and marine customers. Of the 34 partly-LNG-powered-ships operating today, Gasnor has contracts to deliver LNG to 31 of them. Leveraging our combined strengths, we will expand Marine LNG bunkering in the rest of NW Europe and beyond.</p> \n<p>More recently, in the Netherlands, Shell launched the world’s 1st 100% LNG propelled barge “Greenstream” – which is going to operate along the Rhine. And in North America we are developing two new LNG corridors, primarily for the marine industry in the Gulf Coast and Great Lakes areas.</p> \n<p>I have no doubt that we will need to continue to push new physical and innovation frontiers in the future as we move to deeper water and increasingly remote locations, and as the volumes of oil and gas shipped around the world increases.</p> \n<p>As mentioned, the oil and gas industry and the shipping industry have enjoyed a close relationship over the last century and they are becoming increasingly more integrated.</p> \n<p>I see fertile ground for further innovation and value creation for both our industries.</p> \n<p>Jointly we will deliver ever more challenging development projects in remote and harsh ocean environments, and provide energy to markets around the world.</p> \n<p>Bringing together owners and operators across the shipping, and offshore oil and gas industries, to discuss and progress common issues, particularly with regards to safety, will be a positive step forwards. One less safety incident is one more success for the industry</p> \n<p>Thank you.</p>",

          "maintext": "<p><i>The recession has accelerated the shift in economic and political influence from West to East. Meanwhile, the USA’s industrial base is being revitalized by low energy and input costs, thanks to the shale oil and gas revolution. In this speech, Peter Voser warns that Europe must respond to an increasingly competitive global lanscape. He stresses that Europe’s policymakers must do their utmost to support a vibrant and innovative business sector. And calls for the EU to produce clear and straightforward policy frameworks that incentivize innovation and investment. Peter explains that this will not only sharpen Europe’s competitiveness, but also help it respond to the world’s resource and environmental stresses.<br /> </i></p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>Sharpening Europe’s competitiveness</h2><p>I should begin by thanking the CBI for your work in so many areas.</p> \n<p>You’ve reminded people of the importance of a healthy business sector, at a time of public mistrust.&nbsp; You’ve also kept energy on the policy agenda in the UK and Brussels, despite the economic crisis. Today, I’d like to reflect on why those objectives matter more than ever.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I’ll briefly describe some of the major forces shaping the global energy system and business environment.</p> \n<p>I’ll then focus on how the UK and Europe should respond: policymakers must do their utmost to support a vibrant and innovative business sector.&nbsp; This will be critical not just to safeguarding Europe’s competitiveness, but also in addressing the world’s resource and environmental stresses.</p><h2>Resource and environmental stresses</h2><p>Shell’s scenarios team recently published their latest report. For 40 years, this team of experts has produced independent analysis of the global energy system.<b></b></p> \n<p>Their new report assesses how major social, economic and political forces might play out over the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and their impact on the energy system.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The scenarios underscore the enormity of the world’s resource and environmental stresses. Surging demand<b> </b>will put the world’s energy resources under pressure. Global demand could rise by more than three-quarters by 2050, as living standards improve in the emerging economies and the global population increases. To keep pace, the world needs to increase production of all energy sources from fossil fuels to nuclear and renewables.</p> \n<p>The revolution in North America’s oil and gas supplies should help relieve some of the pressure. For example, the US and Canada could soon begin exporting their gas overseas, as Liquefied Natural Gas. That would help strengthen supply security here in the UK. You could import gas directly from Texas or Louisiana – unthinkable only 3 years ago.</p> \n<p>But it’s not just energy resources that will come under stress.&nbsp; So will our water and food systems, which are tightly connected with the energy system.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Water is needed for almost all forms of energy production.</li> \n <li>Energy is needed to treat and transport water.</li> \n <li>And both water and energy are needed to grow food.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The potential effects of climate change will influence all three.</p> \n<p>And global CO2 emissions are rising. A few weeks ago, it was announced that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has reached 400 parts per million.&nbsp; Remember: 450ppm has been identified by climate scientists as the limit for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.<br /> </p><h2>European competitiveness</h2><p>Shell’s scenarios emphasize another powerful trend: the shift in economic and political influence from West to East. In the energy sector, the developing economies will provide almost all the increase in global demand over the next two decades, with China and India leading the way.<b></b></p> \n<p>These countries’ national oil companies are already powerful global players. For example, the China National Petroleum Corporation is developing resources all over the world, including Canada and Australia. It’s also one of the biggest investors in energy innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>What does all this mean for the UK and Europe?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Above all, they must fight to maintain a competitive business environment - one that drives innovation and trade in all sectors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The EU’s industry commissioner published a report last year which emphasized that technology and innovation will be critical to Europe’s recovery and its long-term competitiveness.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thanks to the shale gas revolution, the US is enjoying a massive economic stimulus in the form of lower energy prices. That’s luring manufacturing and chemical companies back to the US, reversing the trend of the past two decades.</p> \n<p>But it’s clear that shale gas won’t provide Europe with the same cheap energy dividend in the near future.</p> \n<p>So the EU must decide how to reinvigorate its own industrial base to ensure that it’s a vital engine of technical expertise, innovation and employment.&nbsp; </p><h2>Closer co-operation between government, business and civil society</h2><p>That raises the importance of supportive government policies, and of Europe’s universities producing the advanced skills in science and engineering that are industry’s lifeblood.</p> \n<p>In other words, we need more effective co-operation between industry, government, and civil society.</p> \n<p>This is not easy in troubled economic times. The current debate on corporate tax is just one symptom of the anger felt towards sections of the business sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But there are encouraging developments taking place, including here in the UK.&nbsp; One example is the British government’s competition to provide funding for a project to capture CO2 emissions from a coal or gas power plant. Shell has entered the competition: we hope to build the first full-scale CCS project for a gas-fired power station at Peterhead in Scotland, with our partner SSE. That kind of collaboration is a small, but important move in the right direction.</p> \n<p>But Europe can do more to nurture its innovation ecosystem.</p> \n<p>This is partly a question of funding: with public finances under pressure, industry can play a role here. At Shell, we’ve invested nearly twenty million pounds in R&amp;D in the UK’s universities over the past five years alone.</p> \n<p>There’s no shortage of innovative ideas in Europe. But they can be painfully slow to reach commercial reality.</p> \n<p>The UK offers a model for accelerating this journey. The Energy Technologies Institute brings together global companies and government to make targeted investments in projects that bridge the gap between development and large-scale deployment. Something similar is called for across the EU as a whole.</p><h2>Need for policy clarity</h2><p>But the most critical step will be for Europe to address the complexity of some of its policy initiatives.</p> \n<p>Clear and supportive policies are essential to a competitive industrial sector. For example, the EU wants a thriving cleaner energy sector to be a powerful source of economic growth. But many of the EU’s energy and climate policies were designed in more prosperous times. In today’s difficult economic conditions, those policies are producing unintended results.</p> \n<p>Europe has seen a drastic slump in the price for carbon. Lower demand for energy during the recession has produced a surplus of carbon trading allowances. That’s slowing the pace of clean energy investment and innovation across Europe.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, the EU has recognized that gas-fired power can play an important role in a more sustainable energy system. That’s because gas power stations emit only half the CO2 of coal. They can also support the growth of renewables. Gas plants provide the most flexible back-up to solar and wind, when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind blow.</p> \n<p>But gas-fired power stations are currently at risk of closure in Europe. And utility companies have delayed plans to build new ones. The problem is that the weak CO2 price is helping coal-fired power to enjoy a revival, and displace natural gas. So Europe is inadvertently pursuing a coal-and-renewables approach, spending a lot of money to subsidize specific renewables while using more coal that generates more CO2.</p> \n<p>To resolve this, the EU should set a single, stand-alone target for greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the period to 2030.</p> \n<p>Currently, there are separate targets for renewables, greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency. That’s contributing to the confusion we see today, especially the target for renewables to supply a set portion of Europe’s energy. Having one target would sharpen the focus on the main task: reducing Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p> \n<p>The most effective way to reduce emissions is to cap CO2 emissions and trade emissions allowances. The market then channels resources towards the most cost-effective reduction measures -- unlike renewable energy targets. But Europe’s scheme must deliver a CO2 price that actually incentivizes clean energy investment and innovation. That’s not happening at the moment.</p> \n<p>In April, the European Parliament voted against proposals that would have helped produce a stronger CO2 price. Later this month, it will consider a revised set of reforms to the trading programme. A positive vote would contribute to meeting the EU’s climate objectives.</p> \n<p>It would also help sharpen European competitiveness by accelerating investment in innovation and new technology. And that is surely a prize worth striving for.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><i>Thank you.</i></p>",

          "summary": "Speech by Peter Voser, Chief Executive Officer, Royal Dutch Shell plc at the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association Conference 2013 in Brisbane, Australia on May 27, 2013.",
          "maintext": "<p><i>Australia is a nation blessed with an abundance of natural gas; its challenge has been that most of this gas is in remote or difficult locations. But thanks to improvements in technology that make tapping these reserves possible, Australia is positioned to become a major player in the world energy market. In this speech to Australia’s largest organisation representing the energy industry, Peter Voser puts Australia’s situation in a global context and discusses the steps the nation needs to take to realise its natural gas potential.</i></p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>Realising Australia’s natural gas potential</h2><p>It is always a pleasure to be back in Australia, especially here in Queensland, with its natural abundance and spectacular beauty. Once you experience Australia, you instantly understand the deep pride and affection its people have for it. So thank you, again, for giving me a reason to return.</p> \n<p>I’ve been asked to discuss how Australia can realise its natural gas potential. But before I go there, I want to share with you Shell’s view of the world, to put Australia’s situation in a global context.</p><h2>World energy outlook</h2><p>Most of you are well-aware of the scale of the world’s future energy challenge. It’s being driven primarily by a rapidly growing population and rising prosperity in the developing world.</p> \n<p>Every 10 days, the world’s population increases by the equivalent of another Brisbane. And every year, millions more people move up from poverty and join the middle class.</p> \n<p>This is one of those good-news, bad-news stories. The rise in prosperity constitutes a remarkable human achievement, a benefit of the global economy. But it also raises issues that promise to become more challenging for all of us to address in the years ahead.</p> \n<p>Millions of people in the developing economies are flocking to rapidly growing cities, where they are using their first appliances and driving their first cars. In other words, they are using a lot more energy.</p> \n<p>This creates a “prosperity paradox”. The ongoing rise in prosperity creates stresses that over time threaten to undermine that prosperity.</p> \n<p>By 2030, we expect demand for energy, water and food to have risen by 40–50%. And that’s not far off: A baby born today will graduate high school in 2030.</p> \n<p>The challenge of addressing these resource needs is magnified many times by the linkages between them:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Water is needed for almost all forms of energy production;</li> \n <li>Energy is needed to treat and transport water;</li> \n <li>And both water and energy are needed to grow food.<i> <br /> </i></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In addition, the potential effects of climate change will influence all three.</p> \n<p>You are seeing evidence of these stresses, and the effort to find the right balance between competing land uses, here in Queensland. It’s a situation that is being duplicated in many parts of the world as the demands on these resources become more acute.</p> \n<p>So it’s clear energy, water and food need to be carefully managed together. We need to understand all the potential linkages and the impacts that one use has on the other. Only then can we make the right decisions.</p><h2>Shell Scenarios</h2><p>At Shell, we spend a lot of time analysing global trends like these. We do so to get a better handle on the future and, hopefully, make better decisions. It is critical, really, because unlike most other businesses, our investment decisions can take 10, 20 or even 30 years to pay off.</p> \n<p>For four decades, our in-house scenarios team has the mandate to look towards the future with an independent, unbiased eye. The future, of course, is neither completely predictable nor completely random. The scenarios give us the tools to anticipate what might happen and allow us to understand our options. In other words, they deepen our strategic thinking. And we share this thinking with governments, researchers, academia and the public.</p> \n<p>In our latest report, the scenarios team analyses how economic, social and political forces might play out through this century, and how those forces could affect the evolution of our global energy system. Here are a few highlights from the report:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>By 2035, both scenarios anticipate the world’s renewable energy sources growing by at least 60%, or even double;</li> \n <li>Yet in each scenario, fossil fuels are still likely to meet about 60% of global energy demand by 2060. That’s because, as I noted earlier, demand is expected to grow so sharply over the next 50 years. And although that’s down from 80% today, we are talking about a smaller slice of a much larger pie, so the demand for fossil fuels will remain strong;</li> \n <li>One of our scenarios foresees a world strongly shaped by market forces, in which oil, natural gas and coal continue to play a major role, as do renewables after 2030. But in this scenario, action to address climate change comes slowly. As a result, coal use continues to rise for decades with a resulting rise in CO₂ emissions;</li> \n <li>In another scenario, the world is strongly influenced by government policies and the abundance of natural gas. Gas becomes the most important energy source globally by the 2030s. This is combined with coordinated global efforts to limit CO₂ emissions, such as government support for carbon capture and storage technology;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Again, these are scenarios, not predictions. The direction we take will depend largely on decisions being made now and through the coming decade.</p> \n<p>But it appears clear that natural gas is poised to play a far larger role in the future. It is increasingly abundant, its supply is increasingly diverse, and it is a natural ally to renewables.</p> \n<p>Renewables are intermittent sources of energy that need another fuel to generate electricity when the wind stops or the sun doesn’t shine. Gas-fired power plants can respond quickly to fill that gap, and when used to replace coal, gas can cut CO₂ emissions in half.</p> \n<p>The abundance of natural gas and affordable prices are already giving the American chemical industry and other energy-intensive industries a global competitive advantage.</p> \n<p>Countries and regions that fail to adopt a strategy to utilise their own shale gas resources could find their manufacturing industries on the losing end.</p><h2>Australia’s position</h2><p>That’s the global context. So where does Australia fit into this overall picture?</p> \n<p>This nation obviously is blessed with an abundance of natural gas. Its reserves of the cleanest burning fossil fuel are well-documented. The big challenge is most of this gas is in remote locations, which is why it has remained undeveloped for years.</p> \n<p>But thanks to improvements in technology that make tapping these reserves possible, Australia is positioned to become a major player in the world’s move towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy system.</p> \n<p>Australia has the advantage of being situated at the front door of Asia, where much of the world’s energy demand growth will occur over the coming decades. And Australia’s emergence as a major natural gas source comes at a time when demand for gas, and liquefied natural gas in particular, is taking off.</p> \n<p>Demand for LNG is expected to double in this decade alone. We see a bright future for LNG, not only as a power source, but as a transport fuel as well.</p> \n<p>In fact, Shell is pioneering LNG for transport in Australia, with a large-scale project being considered to supply LNG as a fuel along Australia’s biggest trucking route. Similar projects are under construction in the United States and Canada.</p> \n<p>These are among the reasons why Australia is a key part of Shell’s growth strategy. We plan to invest about $30 billion (US) in Australia over the next five years.</p> \n<p>But like many other nations trying to develop their resources responsibly, Australia has its challenges. Major investments are needed for facilities and infrastructure to access Australia’s resources. And as you know, rising costs have become a significant challenge for companies doing business here.</p> \n<p>There is also the inevitable challenge of accommodating different land uses and land users, as I indicated earlier. All these issues must be resolved in a fair and practical way if Australia is to move forward.</p> \n<p>In addition, this country is facing rising competition from other gas producers in North America, Asia and East Africa.</p> \n<p>In the end, Australians and their elected leaders will decide how best to address these challenges. There are some steps that, if taken now, can help Australia realise its energy potential:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>First, setting the right regulatory and tax policies to drive innovation and investment;</li> \n <li>Second, putting a priority on education, with a focus on boosting the number of graduates with the skills needed to take on big energy projects;</li> \n <li>And third, industry and government must do a better job of partnering and working together to tackle these challenges.</li> \n</ul><h2>Innovation</h2><p>Innovation is critical to keeping Australia competitive. Our Prelude project is a good example. Work is well under way on what we expect to be the first floating facility to process, store and transfer liquefied natural gas at sea. It will be the largest floating offshore facility in the world.</p> \n<p>It will be used to tap the Prelude gas field more than 200 kilometres off Australia’s northwest coast, a field that is too small and remote to be economically developed in the traditional way. This massive display of technological know-how will eliminate the need to devote land and pipelines to process LNG onshore.</p> \n<p>It also holds the promise to unlock additional significant reserves of already discovered gas that otherwise would not be tapped. In turn, it will create jobs, substantial tax revenue, improve Australia’s balance of trade and provide new opportunities for businesses here.</p> \n<p>Here are a few numbers; over its 25-year expected lifespan, Prelude FLNG will:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Add an estimated 45 billion (AU) dollars to Australia’s GDP;</li> \n <li>Create about 350 direct and 650 indirect jobs;</li> \n <li>Contribute tax revenues totalling more than 12 billion dollars;</li> \n <li>Result in another 12 billion dollars in spending on Australian goods and services;</li> \n <li>And improve Australia’s balance of trade by more than 18 billion dollars through exports of LNG, liquefied petroleum gas and condensate.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Another example of innovation that holds tremendous potential is being developed as part of our Arrow project to convert coal-bed methane into LNG here in Queensland. Shell has teamed with China National Petroleum Corporation to deploy an entirely new drilling concept. It’s called the Sirius Well Manufacturing System.</p> \n<p>It eliminates the need for big, multi-purpose rigs. Instead, the system uses a series of small, mobile, computer-controlled rigs, each designed for a specified task. Sirius will allow Arrow to drill faster, more consistent wells at lower cost and on a significantly smaller footprint, reducing the impact on farm land.</p> \n<p>Here’s one more example, this one from the other side of the world. In Qatar, Shell is converting natural gas into liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks at our massive Pearl gas-to-liquids plant. This $19 billion (US) investment was the culmination of more than three decades of research and refinement to perfect this technology. For countries like Qatar with vast reserves of gas, gas-to-liquids technology provides a way to get more value form their resources.</p> \n<p>Each of these achievements resulted from developing technology to overcome obstacles, then drawing upon our decades of operational expertise to make it work. It’s something we at Shell do well; it’s what we bring to the table.</p> \n<p>With innovation comes smarter, better and more efficient ways of extracting and using resources while protecting people and the environment.</p> \n<p>Although I am proud of Shell’s track record of innovation, the fact is that new technologies just as often originate from small and medium-sized businesses all over the world. Providing incentives that support these businesses in developing new technologies is critical, not just to meet the energy challenge, but to develop your local and regional economies.</p> \n<p>I’m optimistic about the role technology will play in the decades ahead in helping us meet our future energy and climate challenge. But its benefits will come only from a long-term commitment from industry, government and academia to research and find ways to apply that research in the field.<br /> </p><h2>Education and partnerships</h2><p>Government and industry support for education is also a necessity. This is particularly true in Australia, where our industry is dealing with a shortage of employees with specialised technical skills. We are already working in partnership with several universities in Australia to address these needs, but more work needs to be done.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we believe strong partnerships in many areas will be increasingly essential as the world transitions to a new energy future. What our industry needs to do better, and soon, is improve our collaboration with other industries, with governments and civil society. No one company can go it alone anymore; the scale of the energy challenge is too big.</p> \n<p>Shell has a long tradition of partnering and collaborating with other independent oil companies and with national oil companies. In Australia, all of our key upstream projects and exploration activities are in partnership with others.</p> \n<p>Our investment in Arrow Energy to develop LNG here in Queensland is a good example. By partnering with PetroChina, we have the opportunity to strengthen our ties with the Chinese market, to the benefit of Australia.</p> \n<p>Increasingly, we are partnering with leading companies in other industries as well, including IT, aerospace and even video rendering, to create advanced technology solutions to new challenges.</p> \n<p>From our experience, successful partnerships result when both sides are clear on what they want to achieve, when their needs are taken into account in a balanced way, and when they are able to adapt to changing circumstances over time.<br /> </p><h2>Doing it the right way</h2><p>We have also learned over the years that there are no shortcuts to doing our projects the right way. That means being transparent about our plans, respecting and consulting with the communities in which we operate, and addressing public concerns.</p> \n<p>As an industry, we have not always done our best to engage in public debates about resource issues. This often results in misconceptions taking root. We have seen this in North America and elsewhere with concerns about the impact of hydraulic fracturing.</p> \n<p>We need to do a better job of listening and responding.</p> \n<p>To this end, Shell has adopted five operating principles for our onshore tight oil and gas operations. These provide a framework for protecting water, air, wildlife and the communities in which we operate. We have committed to support regulations that are consistent with them.</p> \n<p>Our hope is they can be applied over time to all tight oil and gas operations around the world. We also support regulations to disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, and to promote transparency and public engagement by the tight and shale gas industry in relation to all its activities.</p> \n<p>As an industry, we should insist on strong, consistent regulation and enforcement that ensures everyone in the industry does the job right.</p> \n<p>The good news is we are seeing broader recognition around the world of the benefits of natural gas as it becomes more abundant due to improved technologies, like hydraulic fracturing.</p> \n<p>There are environmental and operational challenges associated with the production of tight and shale gas. But our industry has the expertise to effectively deal with these challenges.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, Australia clearly is in an enviable position when it comes to energy. But Australia also faces many of the same challenges as other countries that are blessed with abundant resources.</p> \n<p>The policy decisions made today will have a profound effect on your economy and society. By embracing innovation, partnership and collaboration, this nation will ensure it has a critical role to play for decades to come in meeting the world’s energy challenge.</p> \n<p>I am optimistic that Australia, with its can-do spirit and pioneer legacy of overcoming challenges, will summon the will to realise its natural gas potential.</p> \n<p>Thank you.</p>",

          "summary": "Speech given by Andy Brown, Upstream International Director, Royal Dutch Shell plc, at the LNG17 Conference in Houston, Texas, USA on April 16, 2013.",
          "maintext": "<p style=\"font-style: italic;\">Given the abundance, environmental acceptability and affordability of gas, Shell believes that it will become an ever-increasing part of the global energy mix over the next two decades. This is good for the planet, good for the economy, and good for the gas business. In this keynote speech at the LNG17 conference, Andy Brown outlines what the industry and policymakers must do to ensure gas can become the leading source of global energy.</p><img src=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/gbr/images-text/imgs/240x178/andy-brown.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Brown\"/><h2>Gas at the heart of a sustainable energy future</h2><p>It is fitting that the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) conference ever is hosted in the United States – a country that recently became the largest gas producer in the world.</p> \n<p>I believe the LNG industry has never been in better shape: it is an industry that is as robust and as dynamic as ever.</p> \n<p>I also believe that we are seeing unparalleled innovation in our industry creating new sources of supply ... and demand for LNG.</p><h2>Robust LNG business</h2><p>Let me start with why I believe the LNG industry is robust.</p> \n<p>Today the world has enough gas for 250 years at current consumption rates. The unconventional gas revolution has transformed our industry, doubling the volumes of economically recoverable gas. The USA alone has over 100 years’ of natural gas supplies at today’s consumption rates.</p> \n<p>Given the abundance, environmental acceptability and affordability of gas, we believe that it will become an everincreasing part of the global energy mix over the next two decades. This is good for the planet, good for the economy, and good for the gas business.</p> \n<p>We believe gas demand will increase by some 60% from 2010 to 2030, with demand in Asia and the Middle East doubling in that period and China gas demand increasing almost five-fold.</p> \n<p>LNG will play an increasingly important role in linking the supply centres with the demand centres as the volumes of gas supply and demand increases. We expect LNG demand to double between now and 2025 increasing from 250 mtpa to 500 mtpa.</p><h2>Tight/shale gas vs. LNG</h2><p>We see gas as a long-term destination fuel in the global energy mix, especially when combined with renewables. We believe that consumers will see the benefits of using gas over coal or liquid fuels in power generation, industrial, domestic and transport applications, cutting CO2 emissions and improving air quality. The recent 11% reduction of CO2 emissions here in the USA proves this point.</p> \n<p>The diversity of supplies, from domestic sources, international pipelines and LNG will also allay concerns over energy security.</p> \n<p>I am often asked if tight/shale gas will undermine the LNG industry. There are two potential challenges:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Will new domestic supply sources substitute LNG import?</li> \n <li>Will oversupply from abundant incremental supply result in price erosion?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>We believe that these additional tight/shale gas resources will actually reinforce the robustness of the LNG business.</p> \n<p>Firstly, the abundance of natural gas will mean that more governments, policy makers and consumers across the world can rely on gas for their long term future, driving an increasing gas and LNG demand globally.</p> \n<p>One example is China, where the enormous increase in gas demand is driving Chinese authorities to plan growth on all fronts in parallel: increasing domestic production, increasing pipeline and LNG imports. This diversity of gas supplies increases the robustness of supply security in China and results in a higher share of gas in the energy mix.</p> \n<p>On the second potential challenge, undoubtedly tight/shale gas will be a great new source of gas molecules for LNG. However, we do not believe North American tight gas will create substantially lower LNG prices once delivered in the Far East.</p> \n<p>Recently we saw Henry Hub prices nudge over $4/MMBTU... and once liquefaction and shipping costs are also accounted for, then unit costs of delivered LNG from the USA to the Far East markets will not be very much different from today’s supplies. This cost base will not allow undercutting LNG delivered from future conventional supplies from Australia or East Africa.</p> \n<p>So, in summary, we believe tight/shale gas will complement rather than compete with LNG and even strengthen the overall proposition.</p><h2>Dynamic LNG industry</h2><p>A measure of the robustness and dynamism of this industry is that here in America just five years ago there were more than 100 mtpa of LNG import projects (over 40% of today’s global supply): yet now there are proposals for more than 200 mtpa LNG for export.</p> \n<p>In Shell we believe around 60-70 mtpa of LNG could be exported from North America, and this is still optimistic given regulatory and cost hurdles. By 2025, we believe North American exports could comprise some15% of global LNG supply. These developments are a testament to the resilience of the industry, demonstrating its ability to cope with such a major swing in supply and demand balances.</p><h2>Shell’s response</h2><p>In Shell we are responding to that opportunity. We are the leading IOC in LNG. Today we hold 22 mtpa of equity LNG capacity and, once the recent deal to acquire many of Repsol’s LNG assets reaches completion, we will add a further 4 mtpa.</p> \n<p>This $4.4 bln deal is a true testimony to our belief in the long term robustness of the LNG business. This deal will not only give us access to over 4 mtpa of equity LNG in Peru and Trinidad, but also to more than 7 mtpa of LNG off take rights, a substantial position for us which fits our portfolio and confirms Shell as a leading LNG trader.</p> \n<p>In addition, we have 7 mtpa under construction in Australia and a further 20 mtpa of equity LNG as options and we expect to remain the leading international oil company (IOC) in the LNG industry for some time to come.</p><h2>Global responses to golden age of gas</h2><p>But of course the world is not perfect and the response to what the IEA has called the golden age of gas has been variable across the different regions of the world.</p><h2>Far East</h2><p>In the Far East we have seen an increasing appetite for natural gas, particularly to tackle air quality issues, but also to benefit from its versatility and reliability.</p> \n<p>New LNG markets open up on a very regular basis; from Thailand to Indonesia to Malaysia. These new markets supplement demand from the traditional markets, which remains robust.</p><h2>Middle East</h2><p>In the Middle East 1.8 million bbl/d of oil is burnt for power generation according to the IEA, the opportunity to import LNG to create a cheaper and more environmentally acceptable alternative is clear and prudently the UAE and Kuwait have started importing LNG, others will follow.</p> \n<p>In the Middle East, LNG is also showing its potential to serve as a rapidly deployable bridge to future domestic supplies that need more time to be developed.</p><h2>Europe</h2><p>In Europe, demand for natural gas and LNG has declined significantly over the last couple of years. Cheap coal exported from the USA has pushed out gas, with a more than 10% increase in the use of coal in power generation.</p> \n<p>Europe’s old coal-fired power stations are running harder than ever before, while brand new super-efficient gas-fired power stations are being&nbsp; considered for mothballing or closure.</p> \n<p>It is ironic that many countries in Europe, crippled with debt, offer subsidies for renewable energy costing well over $100/tonne whilst current CO2 prices languish below $10/tonne.</p> \n<p>I have no doubt that eventually Europe will see the immense value in natural gas and renewables and these energy sources will take their rightful place at the core of European energy supply, particularly for power generation.</p> \n<p>An overhaul of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, along with the establishment of CO2 emission standards for new power generation and the introduction of a CO2 floor price, as planned in the UK are good signs that we are moving in the right direction.</p> \n<p>It is our belief that the Far East, the Middle East and Europe will provide strong LNG demand for the medium and long-term future underpinning our estimate of a 500 mtpa global LNG market by 2025.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><p>But as an industry we are not sitting still awaiting for governments and the public to see the benefits of gas. We are also innovating at a significant rate both in LNG supply as well as demand.</p><h2>LNG in transport</h2><p>We are excited about the opportunities we are unlocking for LNG in transport. In Jumping Pound, Canada, we are building our first 0.25 mtpa small-scale LNG plant for supplying trucks with LNG along a busy route: what we’re calling the “Canadian Green Corridor”.<br /> </p> \n<p>Last month we announced new similar initiatives in the Great Lakes and the Gulf Coast to supply LNG to barges and coastal vessels ... and in Europe we recently launched the first 100% LNG-powered barge for working the waterways of North-West Europe.<br /> </p> \n<p>This business is fast becoming material in size as fleet owners realise the economic and environmental benefit of using LNG over diesel in environmentally sensitive and regulated locations.<br /> </p> \n<p>And the innovation of cost-competitive modular small-scale LNG schemes – such as those we are building in Jumping Pound – is extended further to Elba Island, where we have launched our first US export LNG scheme together with Kinder Morgan. The total project (consisting of two phases)<br /> would have liquefaction capacity of approximately 2.5 mpta of LNG of which<br /> phase one is about 1.5 mpta.</p><h2>Floating LNG</h2><p>Our largest and most exciting innovation, though, is Floating LNG (FLNG). Shell was the first to move ahead with an FLNG project, making FLNG a reality.<br /> </p> \n<p>This will be the largest floating offshore facility man has ever built. It’s approximately the length of a par 5 hole in a golf course. And, when fully equipped and loaded, it will weigh more than 600,000 tonnes. This innovation will enable the development of gas resources ranging from clusters of smaller more remote fields to potentially larger fields via multiple facilities.<br /> </p> \n<p>These projects combine the best of subsea and marine technologies and operations, with optimised LNG facility design and the might and efficiency of the Korean construction yard capabilities.<br /> </p> \n<p>As we move into the hull and topsides fabrication on Prelude, it is clear that FLNG has yielded a step change in LNG opportunities. At Shell, we have other opportunities under consideration for FLNG development and other companies are also progressing their own concepts.</p> \n<p>I am convinced that when we convene for LNG18 in Perth we will see many more FLNG projects under way.<br /> </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, I reiterate: the LNG industry is as robust and dynamic as ever; the natural gas revolution emerging from tight/shale gas will reinforce the LNG industry.<br /> </p> \n<p>As an industry we need to work with governments to point out the benefits gas can provide for delivering a sustainable energy future, to encourage the implementation of regulations and policies, which will provide gas a level playing field on which to compete and take its rightful place as the leading source of global energy.<br /> </p> \n<p>And as an industry we continue to innovate, delivering new sources of supply and new sources of demand, which provide our customers with reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable choices to meet<br /> their energy needs.<br /> </p> \n<p>I sincerely hope that you will use LNG17 to allow resource holders, contractors, and customers to share perspectives and align views in order to further promote our industry, leading to a sustainable energy future, centred around natural gas and LNG.</p> \n<p><br /> Thank you.<br /> </p>",

          "maintext": "<p><i>To open a leading trade conference on offshore exploration and production, Matthias Bichsel, Shell’s Projects &amp; Technology Director, shows how innovation is pushing the boundaries of what is safely achievable in deep water: finding oil and gas resources and developing them through subsea and surface facilities while protecting lives and the environment. He also points out several areas where more innovation – of both a technical and non-technical nature – is needed to overcome the challenges that lie ahead: increasing complexity in project planning and geology; rising capital costs; and stricter government regulations.<br /> </i></p><img src=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/matthias-bichsel240.jpg\" alt=\"Matthias Bichsel\"/><h2>In-depth innovation for the future</h2><p>Good afternoon, or <i>goede middag,</i> as we say in the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>I’m very pleased to welcome you to the 2013 MCE Deepwater Development Conference here in The Hague. This annual gathering is one of the premier global forums for addressing the profound technical, economic and social challenges faced by the offshore energy industry.</p> \n<p>I have a deep personal connection to all matters deep water, since I built and ran Shell’s global deepwater organisation from 1999 to 2002. So I’m thrilled that Shell is hosting this year’s conference.</p> \n<p>Shell has been active in deep water for over 30 years, and we recognise that deep water is becoming ever more important in our industry’s efforts to meet the world's energy needs.</p> \n<p>But as we move into ever deeper waters and take on more challenging projects, and as societal expectations of our industry continue to rise, innovation is becoming an absolute necessity.</p> \n<p>There are many examples of how innovation has pushed the technological boundaries further and made operations safer. I’d like to share with you a few from Shell, as it’s the company I’m most familiar with.</p> \n<p>I will then describe what I believe are the main challenges that the industry’s innovation efforts will have to address as we move forward.</p> \n<p>But first, let me briefly lay out the context.</p><h2>Deep water all over the world</h2><p>The world’s energy needs are growing rapidly, more than doubling in the first half of this century, according to expert estimates.</p> \n<p>Deepwater resources are expected to play an increasing role in helping to meet this energy demand. Of the remaining 2.7 trillion barrels of recoverable conventional oil resources in the world, the IEA estimates 45% is in offshore fields – and 25% of them are in water more than 400 metres deep. If we exclude OPEC countries, the percentages are even higher: 55% in offshore fields, of which one-third is in deep water.</p> \n<p>Today, three deepwater regions – the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and Brazil – stand out. But interest in other deepwater regions, such as south-west Africa and north-west Australia, is growing.</p> \n<p>Shell is an offshore pioneer, and it has been so for quite a while. In 1961, it created the first semi-submersible drilling rig, helping to make the Gulf of Mexico a major oil-producing region. In 1977, it built the first floating production, storage and offloading vessel, opening up the development of deepwater oil fields around the world. And since the eighties, we have been a leader in deepwater operations.</p> \n<p>Today, our share of deepwater production amounts to some 330,000 barrels per day, with a strong growth outlook.<br /> </p><h2>Shell’s deepwater portfolio</h2><p>Our business strategy is designed to make the most of the deepwater opportunities out there. So we now have projects under development not just in the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, Brazil but elsewhere too.</p> \n<p>Take Malaysia, for example. It currently has three deepwater field developments, and Shell’s the operator of two of them.</p> \n<p>The Gumusut-Kakap field is already producing through a tie-back to the nearby Kikeh production facility. Peak production will come once a giant floating production system is in place later this year. Just to fit the production system on top of its hull required a world record lift of 23,000 tonnes.</p> \n<p>Shell’s other deepwater project there is Malikai, which received the final investment decision at the beginning of this year. It’s significant because it marks the first time a tension-leg platform is to be fabricated and installed in Malaysia.</p> \n<p>We’re not just building deepwater platforms but also actively exploring and appraising deepwater all over the world.</p> \n<p>In the Gulf of Mexico, for example, recent significant discoveries have been added to our ‘to do’ list. Appomattox has turned out to be a giant field, with recoverable resources of more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent . And the Vito field also looks very promising.</p> \n<p>We also have plenty of exploration acreage to sift through. In the Gulf of Mexico lease sale last June, Shell was the highest bidder on 24 blocks. Our winning bids totalled more than $400 million. Why did we spend so much? Because the potential is so great: the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates that the production from the June blocks alone could total 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</p><h2>The power of innovation</h2><p>Overall, across our industry, there is an enormous amount of effort and investment going into deep water. This conference is a great opportunity for us to learn from one another, to accelerate progress in these developments.<br /> <br /> I think the conference programme does a good job reflecting the immense power of innovation in:<br /> </p> \n<ul> \n <li>installation and construction techniques;</li> \n <li>floating production systems;</li> \n <li>multiphase flows;</li> \n <li>subsea gas compression;</li> \n <li>the prevention and detection of leaks.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Shell certainly is interested in learning how others are innovating to shape the future of offshore energy. In fact, Shell is firmly convinced of the power of innovation across all of the energy industry. That's why we spend over $1 billion on R&amp;D, year on year.</p><h2>Case study: Mars B project</h2><p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When it comes to deepwater developments, though, innovations are needed to:<br /> </p> \n<ul> \n <li>find oil and gas resources;</li> \n <li>develop those resources through wells and offshore facilities; and</li> \n <li>protect lives and the environment.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>I can illustrate this by telling you the story of our Mars B project. It would never have received the final investment decision without a series of innovations.</p> \n<p>It begins, I have to admit, with a bit of hubris: we thought we fully understood the sub-salt geology at the Deimos prospect, to the west of the Mars field in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> \n<p>But a wildcat well we drilled in 2004 proved us wrong. It did not strike the mother lode we had expected. There was oil on the drill cuttings; so we knew we were close. But we obviously had misinterpreted the squiggles on the seismic images – even though we were using state-of-the-art processing.</p> \n<p>The trouble was the salt. It refracts and diffracts seismic waves every which way, invalidating the approximations used in the processing of the raw seismic signals. So we developed better processing algorithms that took full advantage of the increase in the number-crunching power of computers. And we carried out a new seismic survey – one in which the receivers sat on the ocean floor. This was the second-ever deepwater ocean-bottom seismic survey. It allowed us to “illuminate” the sub-salt structure with seismic waves from all different directions and angles.</p> \n<p>This “all-azimuth”, ocean-bottom survey showed why the 2004 well had missed the oil: it was drilled with the wrong geologic model in mind. The new, clearer seismic images showed faulting to be a characteristic feature of the sub-salt formation.</p> \n<p>On the basis of the clearer imaging, another exploration well was drilled in 2009. And, just a few hundred metres from the original well, we confirmed the existence of the oil-filled structure.</p> \n<p>The new imaging also enabled us to identify another nearby prospect that we successfully tested. These two finds dramatically improved the project's economics.</p> \n<p>That’s the end of the first chapter.</p> \n<p>Chapter two begins with a question: How can we reduce the environmental impact and the cost of drilling wells for the project? Spoiler alert: the answer is an innovative drillship design.</p> \n<p>The Bully drillships that Shell and Noble Corporation developed for such purposes are significantly lighter and shorter than comparable deepwater drillships. Its multipurpose drilling tower can handle 40 metre (or 135-foot) lengths of drillpipe at a time, and it can keep as much as 11,600 metres (or 38,000 feet) of drillpipe to hand in racks, making drilling safer and faster.</p> \n<p>The vessel additionally boasts the latest electronic engine controls and an advanced dynamic positioning system. That combination saves fuel – which in turn not only lowers operating costs but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions.</p> \n<p>The next chapter of the Mars B story revolves around the platform’s design and construction. It has a cast of hundreds scattered among five construction yards and several design offices around the globe. Co-ordinating their work required more than the usual 3D computer-aided designs. The computer applications had to integrate another dimension: time.</p> \n<p>So our design offices took engineering from 3D to 4D. They now have much greater insight into the concurrent activities going on at the construction sites, and that helps keep the work safe and efficient. It also helps keep the project on track despite the vagaries of fortune – like natural disasters. A tsunami in Japan that disrupted steel deliveries to fabrication yards, for example. Or a typhoon that hit South Korea when construction of the hull was taking place there.</p> \n<p>The 4D computer model can also quickly reveal if there would be incompatible activities taking place at the same time in the same place – for instance, if welding on an overhead structure is scheduled for the same week that workmen are painting below. Those activities can then be rescheduled or extra precautions can then be taken for everyone’s safety.</p> \n<p>Indeed, safety is a theme that runs throughout the Mars B story. For instance, we are running fibre-optic cables from the platform all the way to shore. These enhance safety because they enable backup and remote-control systems to be located onshore. Their much greater data-carrying capacity also means that onshore and offshore teams can share much more information in real time.</p> \n<p>Another example: the design of the platform takes many elements that would traditionally be in the hull and places them on the topsides. Personnel will thereby spend less time in confined places.</p> \n<p>We like to think that the Mars B project is creating a model for HSE excellence in deep water – not just with design and technology features, but through the way the extended project team is working with a common vision: no harm to people; no leaks into the environment.</p> \n<p>The project is also making a substantial commitment to social investment. That commitment takes several forms: a $2 million donation to support the restoration of two islands and a stretch of beach in the Gulf of Mexico, for example. Or the support of an orphanage in South Korea, where a major part of the construction has taken place.</p> \n<p>The Mars B story is unfinished. The topsides of the platform are currently being fitted on the hull, and the wells still need to be completed. So several chapters have yet to be written. But I’m confident that, with a few more innovations, it will have a successful end.</p><h2>Key challenges ahead</h2><p>Let’s consider now some of the broader challenges that lie ahead for our industry in deep water. Innovation must save the day here too.</p> \n<p>The first challenge is dealing with the increasing complexity of projects – as much in their subsurface features as in their surface facilities.</p> \n<p>We’ve found that ocean-bottom sensors, like the ones that revealed the Mars B accumulations, provide a good way to peek under salt formations in deep water. But the current method of acquiring the seismic data has one major drawback: the remotely operated vehicles that place and retrieve the sensors. They are costly to operate and require a lot of time to move the sensors – one by one – to and from the seabed.</p> \n<p>To alleviate this cost and time burden, Shell is developing underwater vehicles that can perform that task autonomously. Because the coean-bottom sensors would be deployed in much larger quantities and at lower cost and higher speed, they should increase the resolution and efficiency of marine seismic surveys.</p> \n<p>In the Parque das Conchas project offshore Brazil, Shell intends to introduce another seismic innovation: a full-field ocean-bottom cable installation. It will be the deepest life-of-field installation in the industry. And it will be the first done through the turret of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel. I’m curious to see what it will deliver in terms of time-lapse seismic: comparing the subtle differences in seismic data collected months or even years apart.</p> \n<p>We also are likely to confront more high-temperature/high-pressure reservoirs in deepwater fields. The drilling of wells into the two Gulf of Mexico finds I mentioned earlier – Appomattox and Vito – is rendered more difficult than in other fields in the Gulf because of this.</p> \n<p>As far as the surface engineering is concerned, I have already mentioned how scheduling has to be integrated much more tightly into our planning. But the industry will have to go further – from “4D” to “5D” – adding the availability of materials to the three physical dimensions plus time.</p> \n<p>This kind of progress will be important as we all face up to another challenge for our industry: rising costs. We need to get better at managing capital costs – for instance, through a design one / build many approach. And our operational costs need careful scrutiny and innovative solutions too.</p> \n<p>There are things that can help, like rigless well interventions. Shell has opted for these at Parque das Conchas to boost recovery while keeping the economics viable.</p> \n<p>As a last challenge – but certainly not least in importance – our industry needs to be mindful of stricter government policies and regulations. Just a few weeks ago, for example, the European Parliament proposed legislation that requires operators to submit hazard reports and emergency response plans before being granted a licence to drill offshore.</p> \n<p>The fundamental challenge here is to optimise both safety and production. Shell has several priorities in this area: they include advanced well design, capping systems and downhole technology.</p> \n<p>Recently, we’ve been testing two novel technologies of ultimate resort. One is the Emergency Separation Tool, which uses shaped charges to sever a tubular above the blow-out preventer stack, allowing the tubular to drop below the stack so the BOP can close. The tool cuts clean through heavy-weight drillpipe, drill collars and casings – stuff that the shear rams of the BOP may not be able to cut.</p> \n<p>The second technology is the Collapsible Insert Device. Fixed into a double-walled tubular, it sets off a small, focused explosion to crimp the inner wall and thereby block the well flow downhole. It too would be activated in the event the BOP malfunctions for any reason.</p> \n<p>New technologies like these and others I’ve mentioned, and the many more we will hear about over the coming days, will surely help the industry to overcome its technical challenges.</p> \n<p>But let’s not discount non-technical innovations. By these I mean new ways of thinking and working – which in my view are equally vital to our industry’s success.</p> \n<p>At Shell, for instance, we now recognise that we have to “harvest” all the experience and expertise that already exists around deep water to standardise and replicate as many of the good practices and designs as possible. Standardisation actually requires a surprising amount of innovation.</p> \n<p>We also seek to leverage the benefits of globalisation, and to introduce new contractual arrangements and risk-management techniques for the volatile future ahead.</p> \n<p>An innovative collaboration with Transocean, for example, led to Shell’s order for “7th generation” drillships. These will be even safer and more capable than anything out there today.</p> \n<p>Innovation can also be applied to developing people's talents and skills: for instance with new teaching tools – rig simulators, iPads and the like. I see a particularly strong role for these kinds of tools in promoting a safety-above-all-else mindset throughout an organisation and its partners.</p> \n<p>Whether it’s a matter of tools and techniques, processes and procedures, or strategy and planning, we need to be alert to the possibilities for improvement. Even seemingly small changes in procedure can sometimes yield remarkable results.</p> \n<p>A case in point: On several platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Shell teams no longer have monthly performance reviews. Instead, they have daily 15-minute calls. They review the previous day’s performance and the current day’s targets. Results are written on a white board, with green ink for targets met and red for shortfalls. In 2012, these and other similar techniques helped cut unscheduled downtime by 40%.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m sure there are plenty of other success stories out there – and not only from Shell. So, over the next couple of days, let’s keep our eyes and ears open. I’m sure that there’s a lot for us all to learn. And I also urge you to share what you know, so that others can learn from you.</p> \n<p>This opportunity, at an event with such high level attendance, is rare. It reflects how vital deep water is to the future supply of the world’s energy, and how vital innovation is to pushing the safe boundaries of what is possible in deep water. Let’s make the most of it.</p>",

In this speech in Astana, Kazakhstan, Hugh Mitchell explains why meeting that demand and addressing the associated environmental stresses will require the bright ideas and dedication of a new generation of technicians and business leaders. He talks about what companies can do to respond to the challenge of recruiting and training this new cadre of talented workers.</i></p><img src=\"http://s03.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/hugh-mitchell-cutout.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Mitchell\"/><h2>Managing talent to address energy challenges</h2><p>Thank you and good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back in Kazakhstan. I am always struck by the sense of vitality here. </p> \n<p>I’d like to explore three themes today before handing over to you for discussion. &nbsp;They are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>the significant resource challenges society faces in the coming years;<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>how the world’s surging need for energy and other vital resources presents a human resource challenge, particularly in fast-developing places like Kazakhstan;<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>and finally, what companies can do to attract and develop the talented workers they need to succeed in this rapidly evolving context. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>But first, to give you a sense of my perspective on these challenges, let me give you some background about Shell, where I am the Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer.</p> \n<p>Shell is a global group of energy and petrochemical companies with about 87,000 employees in more than 70 countries and territories. If you include contractors and our retailers, about 1 million people work on Shell’s behalf every day.</p> \n<p>There are about 44,000 Shell-branded service stations worldwide. We serve nearly 10 million customers every day. Shell refuels an airplane every 12 seconds somewhere in the world.</p> \n<p>Our business starts with finding and producing oil and gas. Indeed, we have exploration activities here in Kazakhstan and are major participants in joint venture companies developing the giant Kashagan oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea.</p> \n<p>Our business extends all the way through to refining and delivering to customers fuels, lubricants, chemicals and other high-value products. We earned $27 billion last year. And we invested nearly $30 billion in energy projects worldwide</p><h2>Resource challenges</h2><p>Now, when it comes to energy and other vital resources, powerful forces are shaping the future. Last year the world’s population passed 7 billion. Every day more than 200,000 babies join the human race. At that rate, the planet will be home to 9.5 billion people by 2060. Much of that growth is occurring in Asia.</p> \n<p>Moreover, millions of people are climbing out of poverty for the first time. They are buying their first cars or refrigerators and enjoying a standard of living their parents could only dream about. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Clearly, the world will need more life-sustaining resources, including water, food and energy. Indeed, world energy demand will double by 2060.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, society must address the stresses of a growing population on our planet. That includes the threat of global warming. To avoid the worst effects of climate change, governments, companies and individuals will need to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.</p> \n<p>Shell has a 40-year history of using scenario planning to explore possible future landscapes and aid strategic decision-making. Our latest look into the future explores two possible ways the 21<sub>st</sub> century could unfold, with dramatically different implications for society and the world’s energy system.</p> \n<p>One scenario, named Mountains, sees cleaner-burning natural gas becoming the most important energy source globally by the 2030s. It also sees early action by governments to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The other, named Oceans, sees solar becoming the top source by about 2070, but with slower action to address the threat of climate change.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the scenario, in order to meet surging demand, the world will have to develop all energy sources, from renewables to fossil fuels. Solar and other renewables will grow dramatically from today’s relatively small base. And fossil fuels will continue their role as the world’s primary energy sources for many decades to come.</p> \n<p>Kazakhstan, with its energy riches and its location near Asia’s growing markets, is poised to be an important player in meeting that demand. Indeed, surging demand will be a major opportunity – both for energy-producing countries and for the global energy industry.</p> \n<p>But that opportunity also comes with huge challenges. The age of easy-to-access oil and gas is over. We face increasing technical and environmental challenges in developing new sources of oil and gas. Much of the world’s undeveloped energy resources are in places like deep oceans and the frozen Arctic. And the remaining oil and gas increasingly contains impurities that make them difficult to extract and process.</p> \n<p>The Kashagan field is a prime example. It is one of the world’s largest and most challenging energy projects. It is located in shallow water and is covered by moving ice five months of the year. The oil and gas in the field are under extremely high pressure and must be handled safely. And the field contains high concentrations of toxic and corrosive gasses that must be separated and treated. Moreover, the Caspian Sea is an ecologically unique and precious body of water that must be protected.</p><h2>Human resource challenges</h2><p>So how will society and companies meet surging energy demand while also addressing environmental stresses?</p> \n<p>We will need to harness the innovative ideas and advanced technical skills of a new generation of talented and energetic people. Many more of these people will be needed in places where the energy industry is growing rapidly, but where the pool of talent is still forming. Places like China, India, and of course Kazakhstan.</p> \n<p>This is an opportunity for countries endowed with rich natural resources. Experience shows that over time, a country’s workforce can become experts in new fields -- particularly for the special challenges they face locally. Just look at Aberdeen, in my home country, Scotland. Until the mid-1970s the local economy focused mainly on fishing and paper-making. Then oil was discovered in the North Sea. Today it is a bustling centre for a thriving offshore oil industry. Companies based there now offer their expertise to offshore operators around the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I feel confident Kazakh workers will one day apply their know-how to help develop fields around the world that pose similar challenges to Kashagan.</p> \n<p>In the context of the challenges I’ve outlined, the human resources function plays an important role in ensuring the right people with the right skills are in place to address them. There are two key elements to that role:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Recruiting talented people with the necessary technical skills in the locations they are needed most.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Giving them the experience and training that allows them to function at the top of their profession.</li> \n</ul><h2>Recruitment</h2><p>The highly skilled nature of many jobs in the energy industry makes finding the right people a particular challenge. Last year Shell recruited about 9,000 people worldwide. Two-thirds of them had technical backgrounds. About 3,500 of them were experienced professionals in mid-career.</p> \n<p>I expect we will maintain a similar pace of recruitment this year, and to continue to focus on people with the necessary technical expertise.</p> \n<p>Over the past few years, our recruitment efforts have shifted toward regions where our business is growing. For instance, last year we began construction on a new technical centre in India that will house up to 1,500 experts, adding a third main technology hub to our existing centres in Europe and North America.</p> \n<p>This reflects a strategic shift toward Asia, where future energy demand will be strongest.</p> \n<p>In China, where we are developing hard-to-reach natural gas resources with national oil companies, we recruited more than 500 people last year, up from less than 100 in 2009.</p> \n<p>A look at Shell’s global recruitment over the last five years underscores the shift eastward. Five of the top 10 countries were in the Asia-Pacific region. Of course, we continue to hire people in our traditional bases in Europe and North America. But the trend is clear.</p> \n<p>Now, if you are not familiar with the energy business, you may be surprised by our long time horizon. Major energy projects can take 5 or 10 years to complete. And then they may operate for 30 years or more. With that long-term perspective, we have learned to recruit right through the economic cycle. For instance, during the recent global economic downturn, Shell continued to hire between 800 and 1,000 young graduates every year. That included during a period of corporate restructuring that removed 7,000 jobs worldwide.</p> \n<p>The energy industry hasn’t always been as consistent. In the 1990s when the price of oil hit $10 a barrel, we cut our technical staffs significantly, then found it difficult to scale up again when the market recovered.</p> \n<p>To ensure we have a steady pipeline of young talent coming into the organization, we maintain strong relationships with about 100 top universities around the world. They include Cornell in the USA, Imperial College London, and Southwest Petroleum University in China. For most of these top universities we set up teams of about 10 Shell “ambassadors” who are alumni, or have some other connection to the school. They meet students and discuss the amazing things we do to safely unlock energy. <br /> </p><h2>Skills development</h2><p>Once we’ve recruited good people, we ensure they get the training and experience they need to do their challenging jobs effectively and deliver on strategic priorities. We do a careful segmentation of our work force, looking at which types of jobs and skills are likely to give us a competitive edge.</p> \n<p>We can then focus on developing people with the most critical skills for achieving our strategic goals. That’s especially true for about 10,000 technical specialists in Shell, including geoscientists and project engineers. The human resources function at Shell plays an important role in managing their careers, from recruitment to pay and performance management. That requires an in-depth look at the needs and priorities of the people in these skill pools.</p> \n<p>One priority in recent years has been on improving our people’s project management skills. To give you an idea of the challenge and scale of modern energy projects, look at our Pearl plant in Qatar. It takes natural gas from the world’s largest gas field and transforms it into high-value products, including cleaner-burning liquid fuels and oils for premium lubricants.</p> \n<p>We invested a total of $18 billion to $19 billion in the plant. At the peak of construction, more than 50,000 workers from over 50 nations swarmed over a site the size of 350 football fields.</p> \n<p>The plant is a technical wonder. It took three decades to fully develop the technology and Shell holds about 3,500 patents associated with the production process.</p> \n<p>And Pearl is just one project. We currently have about another 30 projects under construction worldwide. They are part of a four-year capital spending programme of $120 billion to $130 billion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2006 we set up the Shell Project Academy to bolster project management skills.&nbsp; It teaches the technical and commercial skills our people need to be first-class project managers. So far, about 5,500 project engineers have attended academy events. About one-third of them have subsequently completed an internal assessment to validate their skills. That assessment is linked to industry-wide professional organisations that provide independent accreditation of skills. All of this helps Shell complete complex projects on time and on budget.</p> \n<p>We continue to improve the programme. In 2012, an independent benchmarking of high-technology companies that develop major projects ranked the Shell academy second only to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the USA. </p><h2>On-the-job training</h2><p>In addition to formal training, another key element in individual development is on-the-job training. We manage our work force globally, sending talented workers on foreign assignments to gain critical experience.</p> \n<p>That includes sending local hires on short-term assignments in other locations. For example, we sent Chinese engineers to Houston to gain experience and know-how in developing natural gas resources that are trapped in dense rock. The industry in the USA has pioneered the drilling techniques necessary to unlock this abundant resource. We are working with our Chinese partners to learn from that success and unlock their own resources.</p> \n<p>We also maintain an extensive programme of long-term foreign assignments that allows our people to gain valuable experience in a variety of operating environments. Currently, almost 8,000 people, or more than 8% of Shell’s global workforce, is on assignment outside their home country. Nearly two-thirds of them are technical staff.</p> \n<p>During their careers, many of our people get the opportunity to live and work literally all over the world. For instance, right now almost 30% of our expatriates are in the Asia/Pacific region, while more than 20% are in the Middle East. </p><h2>Sharing best practice</h2><p>Increasingly, we are extending these talent management best practices to our partners. That includes joint ventures where we have a significant presence, but do not have management control -- such as here in Kazakhstan.</p> \n<p>This helps our joint venture partners raise skill levels. It’s a win for us and it’s a win for local communities, where the workforce becomes more able. This is one way we support local development, which is often a priority for the countries where we operate.</p> \n<p>Again, our experience here in Kazakhstan provides a good example. We have made a strong contribution to an international posting programme associated with the Kashagan project. Under this programme, KazMumayGas Kashagan nominates Kazakh candidates for international development assignments.</p> \n<p>So far we have arranged international postings for 14 Kazakhs. They have been on two- or three-year assignments in Shell operations in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia and the USA. Two people have already returned to Kazakhstan, bringing with them a wealth of experience.</p> \n<p>Another step was to share our people-management processes and systems with the joint venture North Caspian Production Operations Company, which was created in 2009. This provided an HR backbone that allowed the joint venture to quickly adopt best practices. The systems included resources to manage individual performance and identify skills gaps.</p> \n<p>We had a good deal of internal debate about handing over systems and processes we spent years building and refining. In the end we decided that there were benefits for all, including for Shell. For us this is a test case for sharing HR best practices and systems with non-operated joint ventures across Shell. So far it is going well.<br /> </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To close, let me summarise. The world faces tremendous resource challenges in the years ahead. These challenges represent an opportunity for resource-rich countries like Kazakhstan and for global energy companies like Shell. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Addressing the challenges and making the most of that opportunity requires building a work force with the special skills to get the job done. That means recruiting bright people and providing the training and experience that allow them to create value for their companies, their communities and themselves.</p> \n<p>Thank you. </p>",

          "maintext": "<p><i>Coinciding with the official opening of Shell Technology Center Houston, the Innovation Summit brings together Shell customers and partners, industry observers, academics and environmentalists so that they can see how collaboration leads to innovation. Such innovation fosters the cleaner, safer and more efficient technology that tomorrow’s energy systems need. To this end, Shell scientists and engineers who work to improve the ways crude oil and natural gas are found and produced are integrating their research with that of Shell colleagues who work to improve the subsequent refining and chemical processes. Partnerships with companies outside Shell – indeed, outside the oil and gas industry – also have a crucial role to play.</i></p><img src=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/matthias-bichsel240.jpg\" alt=\"Matthias Bichsel\"/><h2>The high road to innovation and technology</h2><p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Shell Technology Center Houston.<br /> We’ve invited you here to celebrate the start of a new era in Shell's research and development activities in North America.</p> \n<p>This rejuvenated Center brings together in one place, for the first time in the US, the technological power of Shell's science and engineering along the entirety of its integrated value chain – from finding and producing crude oil and natural gas to processing them into refined products for consumers.<br /> </p> \n<p>It’s the largest of three Shell technology hubs – the other two are in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and in Bangalore, India.</p> \n<p>These three hubs link to a network of other technology centres around the world which are, in turn, linked to Shell’s global businesses as well as their customers and partners. Together, they nurture the skills, know-how and creativity that aim to make Shell the most competitive and innovative energy company in the world.</p><h2>The global context</h2><p>Why do we need competitive energy innovation? Simple: to deliver more affordable energy with less environmental stress.</p> \n<p>The UN says that, by 2050, the world will be home to more than 9 billion people, 2 billion more than today. And those people will, on average, be enjoying a better quality of life – including greater mobility, and better access to modern electricity.</p> \n<p>These combined trends ultimately mean increased energy use. By mid century the world will need at least twice as much energy as it did in 2000.</p> \n<p>Such growth has the potential to increase existing stresses on the environment. And it gets more complicated, because there are fundamental interconnections between energy resources, water resources and food resources that constrain their development.</p> \n<p>A challenging prospect! But we at Shell believe that the challenges ahead can be met:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>through energy conservation and efficiency, making the most of traditional resources;</li> \n <li>through more diverse energy sources, adding new ones to the traditional ones; and</li> \n <li>through cleaner and safer energy – with cleaner, safer products and services.</li> \n</ul><h2>The regional context</h2><p>Here in the continental US, a buried treasure has been unlocked in the form of oil and gas that was previously trapped in shale and other “tight” rock formations.<br /> <br /> These new resources offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity for development. The availability of lower-cost energy can support economic growth, job creation and even help safeguard national security.<br /> <br /> Take the Haynesville shale gas field in Louisiana, for instance. The State of Louisiana estimates that it accounts for almost $4 billion in new household earnings for state residents. It has generated more than 30,000 new jobs in the state; and more than $150 million in increased state and local tax revenues.<br /> <br /> Of course, every opportunity has risks associated with it; success is about managing those risks properly.</p> \n<p>One example of how you can do that is Shell's operating principles for tight and shale oil and gas. We published these in 2011, for application across our global operations. The five principles cover safety, water, air, footprint and community. They provide a robust framework for projects to operate safely and responsibly.<br /> <br /> There are other energy-related issues as well. More discussions are needed to address these. Take growing urbanisation as one: Where will the energy come from to move people within cities? To keep them cool during the summer and warm during the winter?<br /> <br /> This is not just a concern for developing countries like China and India. It’s also a major issue here in the US – Houston alone added over 1 million people to its population in the last decade.<br /> </p><h2>Technology</h2><p>In these and many other areas of concern, technology is a driving force for solutions – enabling the US, for example, to seize the newfound opportunity for lower energy costs and less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p> \n<p>Technology helps balance the risks involved in developing unconventional gas fields, through solutions to make drilling safer; to frack wells using less water; to reduce air emissions from drilling-rig machinery; and to lessen the amount of truck traffic.</p> \n<p>Shell addresses challenges like these by focusing human ingenuity and technological capability where they are needed – and we have plenty of both. We’re the only international oil company in <i>MIT Technology Review</i>’s list of the world’s most innovative companies.</p> \n<p>We spend over a billion dollars a year on researching and developing new technologies – more than any of our peers.</p> \n<p>We have 11 dedicated Chief Scientists. All of them are internationally recognised experts in areas of vital scientific and engineering importance to our businesses. Six of the 11 are based here, at Shell Technology Center Houston.</p> \n<p>And, of course, we now have the Center itself. It will focus on advancing technologies for developing unconventional hydrocarbon resources, such as shale gas, shale oil and heavy oil. It will build on the major contributions Shell has already made to developing oil and gas fields in deep water – and also in Arctic locations, where sub‑zero temperatures and ice-covered seas add another layer of complications. These important contributions will continue.</p> \n<p>The Center will also concentrate on the engineering of oil and chemical processing facilities; on developing new, even better fuels and lubricants – not just for the automotive sector but also for aviation; on energy-related biotechnology; and on catalysts for use across all of Shell's chemical processing, whether in a gas plant or in an oil refinery.</p><h2>Collaboration</h2><p>Shell Technology Center Houston provides much more than just new and refurbished buildings to accommodate scientists and engineers who used to work at Westhollow and Bellaire. It also provides an environment in which those scientists and engineers can collaborate, or 'cross pollinate' – sharing ideas and expertise.<br /> This kind of collaboration is crucial to meeting the energy challenge in the US and worldwide. But it doesn’t stop at the doors of Shell. We know one company alone cannot provide all the energy solutions the world needs as quickly as the world needs them.<br /> <br /> That's why our scientists and engineers engage with the best and brightest minds in academia, in our own industry, and in industries that traditionally have had little to do with oil and gas.<br /> <br /> And that's why we're holding this Innovation Summit. We wanted to bring together our customers, partners, environmentalists and industry observers to exchange ideas and share capabilities. And it gives us a chance to share our passion for creating game-changing energy solutions.<br /> <br /> During the Summit, you will hear or see some highlights of our successful partnerships with innovative companies, such as Cisco, Intel and IBM – to name just a few.<br /> <br /> You will also see modular gas-liquefaction plants that can be quickly built inland, near major trucking routes – helping to realise the potential of natural gas as a transport fuel. And there are sophisticated treatment schemes for tailings – the waste water from oil sands – to speed up land reclamation and minimise freshwater use; there are processes to capture CO2 and store it permanently underground; and much more.<br /> <br /> If you’re a scientist or engineer, then this is a very exciting place to be!</p><h2>The local context</h2><p>Shell expects this Center to continue its track record of 'firsts' and 'bests' in technology, both upstream and downstream of refineries and gas-processing plants.<br /> <br /> Many of those historical milestones originated in Bellaire and Westhollow. Open virtually any textbook on petroleum geology, petrophysics, oil refining or catalytic chemistry and you will come across the names of people who worked either at one or the other location.<br /> <br /> Today, Shell Technology Center Houston stands as a modernised and expanded facility that combines the best of Bellaire and Westhollow, with improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact – including a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions.<br /> <br /> With the formal opening of the Center, Shell is very excited to have reached another milestone.<br /> <br /> Thank you for joining us to celebrate it as we embark together into the next era of our innovation journey.</p>",

          "maintext": "<p><i>At an EU conference on the role of media in responsible research and innovation, Matthias Bichsel, Shell’s Projects &amp; Technology Director, argues that questions of energy policy must be resolved through fact-based debate. Research helps policmakers, technologists and journalists get the fundamental facts. On the basis of those facts, the public and private sectors can then collaborate to drive forward the energy-related innovation that society needs. The transition from small-scale development to large-scale deployment needs particular care. The media’s role is to keep everyone honest.</i></p><img src=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/matthias-bichsel240.jpg\" alt=\"Matthias Bichsel\"/><h2>Do the research</h2><p>Good afternoon, everyone. I’m very pleased to take part in this summit – especially in these impressive, historic surroundings.</p> \n<p>I wish the Irish Government continued success in its presidency of the European Council. I know it’s progressing a number of key issues around energy and technology. Shell looks forward to contributing to this work.</p> \n<p>As director of Shell's global Projects and Technology organisation, I must ensure that all of Shell’s activities have the technology capabilities and expertise they need. I also oversee safety and environment across the Shell group of companies.</p> \n<p>So responsible research and innovation are right at the centre of my radar screen.</p> \n<p>Today I want to highlight the importance of good research for responsible innovation – and for responsible communication about it.</p> \n<p>This might seem like a truism. But experience shows – time and again – how poorly researched news reporting can curb the political appetite to implement the necessary policies to capitalise on innovation.</p> \n<p>I also want to highlight the need for a proper understanding of innovation: not just great ideas in the lab, but something that gets deployed in the field to add value to business, the economy and society.</p><h2>Role of research</h2><p>Research for innovation is vital in the energy industry. I’m talking about targeted, objective research that benefits stakeholders across the board. Without it, the EU would not have the innovations it needs to address the very ambitious decarbonisation agenda in the coming decades.</p> \n<p>But what we read or hear about these innovations doesn't always do them justice.</p> \n<p>Here’s one example: carbon capture and storage, or CCS. The International Energy Agency has said that, if CCS is progressed rapidly, it could account for 19% of the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction effort that’s globally needed by 2050. The IEA has also said that, without CCS, the cost of tackling climate change could be 70% higher.</p> \n<p>Yet several EU member states have stepped back from supporting CCS, even though it involves proven technologies – and now just needs support for demonstration and deployment on a commercial scale.</p> \n<p>In the UK last month, the Labour party accused the Government of cutting its pot for supporting commercial-scale CCS projects by 80% over the next few years. The EU's NER300 scheme supporting CCS and renewables projects is also reported to have shrunk – from €6 billion to less than €1.5 billion – because of the low CO<sub>2</sub> prices.</p> \n<p>Disappointingly, in the first round of NER300 funding announced last December, all the €1.2 billion allocated went to 23 renewable-energy projects. Not a single CCS project benefitted.</p> \n<p>Don’t get me wrong. The EU will undoubtedly need renewables. So it’s good those projects got funding. But renewables alone will not be enough. Nor might they be the cheapest way to decarbonise energy.</p> \n<p>In 2050, even with rapid growth in renewable energy sources, fossil fuels are still likely to provide the majority of global energy.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the re-emergence of coal as a fuel of choice for power generation in Germany is particularly worrisome. The growth of coal without CCS can only hinder progress towards emissions reduction targets, and has serious implications for climate change.</p> \n<p>The time for action is now. There needs to be funding support for CCS demonstration projects; and an appropriate carbon price to ensure CCS deployment. Additional measures are needed to compensate for the reduced value of the allowances to be auctioned from the NER. And collectively, we need to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration within the EU and internationally. This will help to capture the best engineering value in CCS demonstration projects, and push deployment costs down.</p> \n<p>The EU requires a balanced, fact-based debate on CCS as a matter of urgency. And good research is vital to fuel that debate.</p><h2>Role of innovation</h2><p>Obviously, research also fuels the ongoing innovations themselves. Shell spends over $1 billion a year on R&amp;D. We’re at the top of the Patent Scorecard in the energy and environment sector. We’re on last year’s <i>MIT Technology Review</i> list of the 50 most innovative companies in the world, and this year’s Boston Consulting Group list.</p> \n<p>But innovation is not just about having good ideas. It’s about turning good ideas into reality, at the pace and quality required.</p> \n<p>In Shell, we spotted a bottleneck in our own organisation at that critical juncture between laboratory-scale R&amp;D and large-scale commercial deployment. We now recognise that, even in the early stages of technology development, it’s essential to tackle head-on questions about scalability, replication and standardisation.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the Energy Technologies Institute brings together global companies and government to make targeted investments in projects that bridge the gap between development and deployment.</p> \n<p>Something similar is called for across the EU. We need a better handover from small-scale development to large-scale deployment. And that requires sustained investment and close collaboration between the public and private sectors.</p> \n<p>On this issue, again, informed debate is needed – urgently.</p><h2>Role of media</h2><p>Academics play an important part in such debate. They do much of the necessary investigation. And generally, the public trusts them more than they do businessmen, politicians or journalists.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the media also shape public debate.</p> \n<p>As the EU works towards an energy and climate-change framework for 2030, the media will question many things: the role of renewables; the role of natural gas; emission targets; funding for the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> \n<p>I firmly believe in freedom of the press. It is a right, but also a great responsibility. There are many admirable, responsible journalists and news editors around the world. The less professional or accomplished ones are like football hooligans – few in number, but they’re the ones everyone notices.</p> \n<p>Online or offline, mainstream or specialist – the media have a duty to properly frame debate: To make sure government officials and business leaders answer the right questions, using facts rather than opinions or uninformed theories. They must also hold policymakers accountable for their promises to deliver a cleaner, broader, more efficient energy system – which means supporting lab-based innovation <i>and</i> scaling up and commercialisation.</p> \n<p>Shell believes the best incentive for cost-effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is an overarching target, supported by a strong Emission Trading Scheme.</p> \n<p>Yes, ETS prices have collapsed recently, partly because of the economic downturn. But we should not ignore the impact of overlapping policies for energy efficiency, renewable electricity, transport biofuels and so on. Nor should we ignore how the ETS price collapse has led to natural gas being squeezed out in favour of coal in the EU, as I mentioned.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude: Well-researched innovation can drive the global energy system forward at the required pace and with the desired environmental, economic and social performance.</p> \n<p>Media, government, business, academia and society – all have roles in making this happen. And all have the responsibility for ensuring they are properly informed through research – good research – so that they can carry out their roles.</p> \n<p>I look forward to the upcoming exchange of views.</p>",

America suddenly has a 100 year supply of natural gas “in the bank” and the world has 250 years – thanks in part to breakthroughs in the technology that unlock hydrocarbons from tight rock and shale.</p> \n<p>These new resources are not just a source of energy but a source of cleaner, more affordable, more secure energy than any other of a similar scale.</p> \n<p>The gas revolution is a creator of new jobs...a catalyst for a renaissance in American manufacturing…a bridge to future renewable…and (with carbon capture and storage) a destination fuel for an increasingly carbon-constrained economy.</p> \n<p>At the same time the boom in North American gas is re-drawing the geopolitical map of the world as North America shifts increasingly towards self-supply and even energy exports.</p> \n<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) this month caught a lot of people’s attention by predicting that the US (in part because of the same technologies that have expanded our production of gas) would exceed Saudi Arabia as the world’s leading oil producer by 2020.</p> \n<p>This, of course, has the potential to radically change the geopolitical calculations in capitals around the world.</p> \n<p>Certainly it is influencing investment strategies in companies like mine.</p><h2>A Four Pillar Strategy For Gas</h2><p>Shell is already the world’s leader in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).&nbsp; Shell ventures delivered more than thirty percent of all the world’s LNG volumes in 2011.&nbsp; We have eight LNG projects in operation today with three new projects under construction globally, served by 52 LNG tankers and delivering clean-burning energy to markets around the world.</p> \n<p>Our integrated gas earnings have more than tripled in the last five years, and as demand for natural gas increases some sixty percent by 2030 we see opportunities to invest more than $20 billion in this space over the next three years.</p> \n<p>In the United States specifically we’re exploring four pillars for our gas strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The first is to channel gas into the chemicals industry where it can support the expansion of domestic manufacturing.</p> \n<p>The second is to convert gas into liquid petroleum products like synthetic diesel and base oil.&nbsp; We’re doing that already in Qatar, with a proprietary “gas-to-liquid” – or GTL – technology, which by itself was a close to $20 billion investment.&nbsp; We are evaluating an opportunity to do something similar along the US Gulf Coast.</p> \n<p>The third is to open up more opportunity to use natural gas in transport, something I’ll come back to in a few minutes.</p> \n<p>And finally, we’re looking at opening a channel for LNG exports from the US to energy-hungry markets.</p> \n<p>These are all big changes.&nbsp; They create important new options - not just for the oil and gas industry but also for policy makers and manufacturers.</p> \n<p>But I will come back to where I started and say that change is no longer news.</p> \n<p>We’re constantly waking up to something new in our industry: some new technical breakthrough…some new peak or trough in the economic cycle…some new geopolitical eruption in the world…a new social or environmental concern that needs to be tackled.</p> \n<p>So I’d like to shift gears slightly and suggest what is “unchanging” about all that change.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What are some of the constants underpinning this natural gas revolution?&nbsp; And where is the trajectory of those constants likely to lead?</p> \n<p>Three obvious themes emerge, not only from the recent past, but also the predictable future.&nbsp; Those themes give us some pretty good clues as to how we need to think about the next half century of our business.</p> \n<p>The first consistent theme (and no surprise) is the world’s increasing appetite for energy.</p><h2>Meeting The Needs of 9 Billion People</h2><p>Let’s not forget that our business is not just about molecules and money, but about people.&nbsp; Roughly a billion people in developing parts of the world are just now entering the market for the cars, washing machines, refrigerators, and computers that they see in the developed world.&nbsp; Every day the world is home to nearly 200,000 more people who are consuming more products…and expecting more physical and social mobility…and living in more dense urban centers.</p> \n<p>By 2050 our children will share this planet with 9 billion people.</p> \n<p>That means the world will be adding the equivalent of a city of one million people, say the size of Rochester, NY, every week for the next 30 years.</p> \n<p>Every one of those cities, every one of those people, will need energy to survive and to thrive.&nbsp; That means the global demand for energy could grow dramatically by the middle of this century.</p> \n<p>And that leads directly to a second consistent theme, which is that we’re going to have to work harder and innovate more to keep energy supplies growing as fast as energy demand.</p> \n<p>It’s true that the world’s total supply of energy has never failed to meet demand…not yet, anyway.</p> \n<p>And it’s true that technology breakthroughs have resulted in such a short-term glut of natural gas in this country that fears about supply seem irrelevant.&nbsp; Even as we speak natural gas prices are coming through a significant trough and some companies that piled-in are now scrambling to retrench.</p> \n<p>But it’s also true that demand growth over the medium- to long-term will continue to force us to greater lengths, greater depths, greater temperatures, greater pressures, and greater imagination to make sure a shortfall in energy supply doesn’t happen.</p> \n<p>Even if energy efficiencies – spurred by innovation and competition – reduce growth by, say, 20 percent, and even if ordinary rates of supply growth (including the current revolution in natural gas) boosts supply by 50 percent…we could still face a gap between supply and demand equivalent to the size of the entire industry in the year 2000.</p> \n<p>And “ordinary” rates of growth don’t necessarily reckon with post-recession volatility, the European banking crisis, geopolitical upheaval, regulatory uncertainty, and changing perceptions of risk.&nbsp; All of which make “ordinary” unlikely.</p> \n<p>And that’s even before allowing for the third consistent theme in our industry, which is how much less society is willing to accept the side effects of energy.</p> \n<p>Energy is the oxygen of human existence and yet producing it causes pressure on environments and social fabric in every corner of the globe.&nbsp; Using it causes even more.&nbsp; We owe it to our shareholders and stakeholders alike to keep finding new ways to relieve or eliminate those pressures.</p><h2>The Business of Energy</h2><p>For Shell, those ways take many different forms.&nbsp; Everything from investing in a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project in Alberta that will capture and safely store, deep underground, more than a million tons of carbon from our oil sands operations every year…to advocating for a global market framework that puts a reasonable price on carbon emissions…to developing and implementing detailed principles for how we will safely and responsibly drill for gas…to hiring 150 wildlife observers in our Alaska exploration program to watch out for fish and mammals that may be affected by our presence…to developing fuels and lubricants in our downstream business that help customers use less fuel and emit less greenhouse gasses.</p> \n<p>The list goes on.</p> \n<p>These things are important to our license to operate today.&nbsp; They are even more important to our competitive edge tomorrow.</p> \n<p>To the careful observer…to anyone thinking about what the world’s energy system is going to look like by the middle of this century…at the very least to anyone plotting a blueprint to competitiveness in this industry…I think these three themes send a very loud signal.</p> \n<p>That signal is this: more than ever before we will need to think about the business of energy as only one part of a complex global system of interconnected challenges.&nbsp; And succeeding in our business will mean coming up with integrated and innovative solutions and partners to tackle those challenges.</p><h2>Business And Government – Regaining Public Trust</h2><p>The most obvious collaboration is between business, government and society.&nbsp; In too many ways this critical relationship is broken.&nbsp; Public trust in the motives and values of “Big Business” has been battered for much of the last two decades.</p> \n<p>For the last ten years the Edelman Public Relations Agency has surveyed citizens in 25 countries for its annual “Trust Barometer.”&nbsp; According to this year’s barometer, trust in business has rarely been lower.</p> \n<p>And it shouldn’t make us feel any better that trust in government is lower yet.</p> \n<p>The presidential campaign that ended this month exposed at least the perception of an angry divide between Americans who want this country to unshackle economic opportunity for individuals and businesses on one hand and those who want this country to protect the common good on the other.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> But there doesn’t have to be a divide.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I can point to real examples where business and government work together to secure both the opportunity and the protection.</p> \n<p>One that may surprise you is related to new exploration for energy offshore Alaska.&nbsp; There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that massive resources of energy lie under the waters off the North Slope of Alaska.&nbsp; And those resources could be critical to the nation’s economy as well as its long-term security.</p> \n<p>But developing those resources comes with significant financial, social, and environmental risks.&nbsp; So how do you balance those rewards and risks against each other?</p> \n<p>Well, you can’t.&nbsp; At least not effectively unless government, society and business work with one another to define expectations, agree on operational standards, and collaborate on solutions.</p> \n<p>In this case the past two Administrations looked hard at what Shell was prepared to do in Alaska.</p> \n<p>They did their due diligence.</p> \n<p>I believe that this Administration sees these resources as critical and strategic to the nation and part of their “all of the above” energy strategy.</p> \n<p>I also like to think the Administration sees Shell as a capable partner in developing this national resource.</p> \n<p>To enable this they created an unusual interagency group to “clear a path” through the aggravating thicket of Federal regulatory bureaucracy.&nbsp; At the same time, we at Shell worked day in and day out with federal officials, state government, and local communities to create one of the most comprehensive and sophisticated exploration plans ever devised.</p> \n<p>Another area where we agree with the Administration is that there is a way and a need to establish a faster, more efficient, more predictable and even more thorough permitting process for our industry.&nbsp; And we are working together on this.</p> \n<p>But getting there means that government needs to know it can trust industry to operate safely, to be committed to reducing the impact of operations, and to respect public interests along with business interests.</p> \n<p>Industry needs to know it can trust government not to impose arbitrary burdens and delays, not to vilify business, and to set clear and consistent policies that can inform our long-term investments.</p> \n<p>And society needs to know it can trust both business and government to do their jobs in a way that soberly balances risks and rewards.</p> \n<p>It can be done.</p><h2>Finding Solutions Through Cooperation</h2><p>Innovative and integrated solutions and partners don’t just apply to companies and government.&nbsp; We’re also cultivating valuable new collaborations between producers and consumers of energy.</p> \n<p>Take, for example, what we’re calling Gas-to-Transport initiatives (that’s natural gas).</p> \n<p>From 2012, we’re making LNG available as a transport fuel for specially adapted trucks on a route that runs from Northern Alberta, Canada to Vancouver.&nbsp; This can replace the diesel that previously powered these trucks.</p> \n<p>We also recently signed a memorandum of understanding with TravelCenters of America to sell LNG to heavy-duty road transport customers in the US at about 100 sites nationwide.</p> \n<p>We have a joint cooperation agreement with Wartsila North America to accelerate the use of larger marine engines using lower-cost, lower-emissions LNG and a similar agreement with GE for railroad locomotives.</p> \n<p>In a separate initiative we’re working with suppliers, state governments, business customers, and our own chemicals business on the possibility of an ethylene cracker in Appalachia that would convert natural gas into jobs, fuel and raw materials that could form the basis of renewed manufacturing in that region.</p> \n<p>Were working with companies like Coca Cola, JP Morgan Chase, Nike, Suncor, UPS, and Wal Mart on a project relating to the Future of Fuel to aid producers and consumers of transport fuels in analyzing the wide range of fuel choices they face.</p> \n<p>Looking even further over the horizon, we’re working with companies like IBM and Dow on initiatives related to the “interconnection” of the three biggest stressors facing the planet over the next few decades: water, food, and energy - what many are calling a “stress nexus.”</p> \n<p>We see a vital need to manage the demand and the supply of those resources more intelligently, from reducing demand through much more efficient consumption, to smarter employment of natural eco-system services.</p> \n<p>The solutions will require not only understanding how the use of those resources affect each other, but also working together across sectors to develop and implement solutions on local, national and global levels.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So yes, the revolution in our industry today is mainly about new, unconventional resources, like shale gas.</p> \n<p>This year’s news is about how companies like Shell and governments around the world will manage new investment opportunities, new patterns of trade, and new ways of capturing value.</p> \n<p>But the story won’t stop there.</p> \n<p>The three unaltered themes of change will continue well into the middle of this century.&nbsp; The future for the leaders of our industry is going to demand thinking more broadly about the purpose of our business about the nexus of energy with other critical resources, and about new and innovative collaborations for solving critical societal challenges.</p> \n<p>My expectation is that next year at this conference we will be talking more about integrated solutions to some of those challenges.</p> \n<p>Thank you.</p>",

          "maintext": "<p><em>Only a decade ago, Canada dramatically increased its proven oil reserves, as the oil sands became commercially viable on a large scale. Now the tight gas revolution is providing another historic shift in the country’s energy supplies. Nevertheless, there is persistent public concern on both sides of the Atlantic about the environmental impact of developing these resources. In this speech, Shell CFO Simon Henry describes how Canada can become a major supplier of energy to the world by increasing its exports. He also explains how Canada’s supply revolution could help strengthen Europe’s energy security, as competition for global supplies intensifies, and benefit its economy, not least by mitigating oil price volatility. Simon also suggests that Canada’s leadership in progressing carbon capture and storage technology will not only help to tackle the oil sands’ CO2 emissions profile, but also inject fresh momentum into the technology’s overall development, which is so important to realising Europe’s long-term environmental aspirations.</em></p><img src=\"http://s03.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240x178/simon-henry.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Henry\"/><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Today, I’ll discuss Canada’s burgeoning energy sector and what it means for Europe.</p> \n<p>As the trade negotiations between Canada and the European Union near their conclusion, it’s an appropriate time to reflect on the strength of our ties.</p> \n<p>This is at risk of being overshadowed by the debate about the oil sands – a debate coloured by some highly charged rhetoric here in Europe.</p> \n<p>Last year, the value of the bilateral trade in goods between the EU and Canada was more than 50 billion euros (around 64 billion Canadian dollars). The EU is Canada’s second most important trading partner. And, as I’ll explain, Europe also has a stake in Canada’s energy supply revolution.</p> \n<p>It’s remarkable to reflect that it’s only a decade since Canada increased its proven oil reserves from 5 billion barrels to 180 billion, as the oil sands became commercially viable on a large scale. Today, the tight gas revolution is providing another dramatic shift in the landscape.</p> \n<p>Of course, we’re seeing historic developments throughout North America. Only last week, the International Energy Agency suggested that the US could be nearly self-sufficient in net energy terms by 2035 – something that also carries implications for Canada.</p> \n<p>So, today, I’ll cover three main points:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> First, that Canada can become a major supplier of oil and gas to the world; </li> \n <li> second, the implications for Europe; </li> \n <li> and, third, the need to tackle the environmental challenges associated with the oil sands. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>To put all this in context, I’ll begin with the global picture.</p> \n<p>Global energy demand is expected to double in the first half of this century, propelled by an expanding global population and rising wealth levels in the emerging economies.</p> \n<p>To keep pace the world must invest heavily in all energy sources, from oil and gas to biofuels, solar and wind. Indeed, the world may need to spend some $37 trillion on the global supply infrastructure by 2035, according to the IEA. That’s more than $30 billion every week.</p> \n<p>The pressure on the world’s oil resources will be especially acute.&nbsp; As demand rises, production in mature fields will decline fast. The world will need to produce around 30 million barrels of oil a day by the end of this decade from new fields that have not been developed yet. That’s about three times what Saudi Arabia produces today.</p><h2>The opportunity for Canada: oil</h2><p>That’s why the world can’t afford to ignore the Canadian oil sands.</p> \n<p>Canada’s proven oil reserves are the world’s third largest. And its oil production could increase by more than three-quarters over the next 25 years (IEA), which would make it one of the biggest sources of growth in global oil supplies.</p> \n<p>This production is underpinned by a rising flow of international investment. China’s national oil companies are much in the headlines, but Europe’s energy companies are also front and centre. At Shell’s Athabasca Oil Sands project in Alberta, we’ve developed a business capable of meeting more than 15% of Canada’s oil demand in less than a decade.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But it’s not all about the oil sands. At Shell, we’ve expanded our exploration presence in the deep waters of the Atlantic – 200km off the coast of Novia Scotia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And then there’s the Arctic. Taken as a whole, the Arctic region could hold 14% of the world’s undiscovered technically recoverable oil, and more than a quarter of its yet-to-find gas. Canada began exploring for resources there several decades ago. And if the country can overcome the challenges of bringing them to commercial reality, the opportunities could be substantial.</p> \n<p>Despite Canada’s oil abundance, the USA still dominates its exports. And the US’s import needs are declining as it enjoys its own revival in oil production, thanks to its tight oil resources.</p> \n<p>The US’s oil production increased by more than 15% between 2008 and 2011.</p> \n<p>In fact, the IEA is now suggesting the US could even become the world’s biggest oil producer by 2020.</p> \n<p>In the short term, this production growth has helped to create a bottleneck in North America’s oil distribution infrastructure, and depressed the price of Canadian crude.</p> \n<p>Of course, the Keystone XL pipeline extension would provide a major new outlet for Canada’s oil by linking the oil sands with refineries on the Gulf Coast and export markets further afield. Despite the political debate, we’re confident that the US government will take a balanced view of the issues, and allow the extension to proceed.</p> \n<p>Even so, the US’s oil production revival will still carry significant implications for Canada:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> The IEA predicts the US could reduce its reliance on imported oil from more than 50% of consumption today to less than 30% in 2035. </li> \n <li> The US’s net oil imports could fall by two-thirds over that period. (Efficiency gains will also play a part here.) </li> \n <li> Due to its growing tight oil resources, the US may convert more refineries to process lighter oil. That would leave heavier crudes from Canada facing even more intense competition. </li> \n <li> North America could become a net oil exporter by 2030.&nbsp; But the challenges of getting to this point should not be underestimated, in terms of investment and infrastructure. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>All this adds up to a compelling case for Canada to broaden its export horizons and send more oil to Asia -- especially when you consider China’s oil demand could increase by two-thirds over the next 25 years. To help that happen, there are&nbsp; proposals to expand the pipeline network to carry more oil from Alberta to the Pacific Coast.</p><h2>Natural Gas</h2><p>There’s a similar story to be told about Canada’s gas resources.</p> \n<p>There are sizeable resources of tight gas, shale gas and coal bed methane in Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec. These are all gas resources which have become commercially viable because of advances in production techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing.</p> \n<p>We all know that this has transformed the US’s gas supply outlook.</p> \n<p>Canada is still in the early stages of exploring the potential of its tight gas resources. But they’ve already reversed the long-term decline in Canada’s gas production. And according to the US Energy Information Administration, Canada’s technically recoverable shale gas reserves could be as much as 388 trillion cubic feet – enough to meet its gas needs for more than a century, at current consumption rates.</p> \n<p>As a first step, this is fuelling rising gas consumption within Canada.</p> \n<p>For example, provinces like Ontario are using natural gas to displace coal fired power.</p> \n<p>In the US, this has already had a dramatic impact. In 2012, energy-related&nbsp; CO2 emissions for the first quarter were at their lowest in 20 years (US EIA). A major reason is because gas plants emit around half the CO2 of the coal they’ve replaced.</p> \n<p>In the not-too-distant future, Canada is also likely to become an exporter of liquefied natural gas. Several projects are on the table.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Demand for LNG in Asia could rise by more than three-quarters this decade, as China and other countries attempt to ease their coal consumption. More broadly, global gas demand could increase by around half between 2010 and 2035, according to the IEA’s latest estimate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the USA, Canada’s sole existing export market, is awash with gas. And North American gas prices plunged to $2/MMbtu earlier this year, their lowest point in a decade. By contrast, the spot price for LNG in Asia for December is around $14/MMbtu.</p> \n<p>All of which suggests LNG exports could be a powerful engine of tax revenues and royalties for Canada.</p> \n<p>Shell recently announced our aspiration to develop an LNG export facility near Kitimat, British Columbia.</p> \n<p>With our Asian partners, the project would design, construct and operate a plant with an initial output of some 12 million tonnes a year – roughly the same amount China imported last year. But there’s a long road ahead, and our investment must first win regulatory approval and the backing of local communities.</p><h2>Europe’s stake</h2><p>Europe also has a stake in Canada’s energy supply revolution – even if it’s not a direct importer of Canadian oil or gas.</p> \n<p>Europe’s energy companies are playing a major role in Canada. For example, it’s now home to roughly 8% of Shell’s global oil and gas production, and an even larger portion of our resource base. And our suppliers in the oil sands include businesses from Germany, Switzerland, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK.</p> \n<p>To get a sense of the economic benefits, consider that the UK’s oilfield goods and services sector earned some &pound;6 billion in exports to countries around the world last year, with Canada a leading destination.</p> \n<p>And the success of Shell’s Canadian investments is now critical to our overall success. In turn, Shell’s success brings important benefits to Europe: last year, we paid around 12% of all the dividends in the FTSE 100.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Europe’s oil and gas import dependency is growing.&nbsp; And Canada can ease the pressure on global resources by helping to meet Asia’s surging demand.</p> \n<p>That would help to mitigate the risk of high and volatile oil prices in Europe and the rest of the world. To see why this matters, consider the IEA’s warning earlier this year that the EU could spend more than $500 billion on net imports of oil in 2012 if high prices persisted. That would be equivalent to nearly 3% of its GDP.</p> \n<p>Without Canada’s oil and gas, countries like the UK will face even more competition for energy supplies from China and other emerging economies.</p> \n<p>LNG is a case in point. The EU has signalled that gas will have an important role to play in its energy mix in the decades ahead – not least as the most effective back-up to intermittent sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind.</p> \n<p>But there are currently worries about Europe’s ability to secure LNG supplies –despite investing heavily in import capacity over the past decade.&nbsp; For example, imports to the UK are tentatively estimated to have dropped by around 40% in the first half of 2012 compared to a year earlier (Wood Mackenzie).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This has its roots in Asia, where LNG demand has surged - partly because Japan’s gas needs have risen in the wake of last year’s Fukushima tragedy. That’s reduced the number of cargoes available for Europe.</p> \n<p>But Europe’s LNG supply picture will improve at the end of this decade, as new supplies from Australia and North America come on-stream. These will help to satisfy Asian demand, freeing up supplies for the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>Canada’s proposed export projects could add up to more than 30 million tonnes of LNG a year. That’s nearly half the amount of LNG imported by Europe last year, although not every project will necessarily come to fruition.</p> \n<p>All this should leave sizeable quantities of LNG from the Middle East looking for a home in Europe.</p> \n<p>So Canada’s supply revolution can also strengthen Europe’s energy security.&nbsp;</p><h2>Public concern</h2><p>But there is uncertainty about the pace at which Canada will be able to realise the potential of its energy resources.</p> \n<p>One critical factor will be how the industry addresses public concern about the environmental impact of oil sands production, most notably its CO2 emissions profile.</p> \n<p>This, as much as the oil sands’ economic competitiveness, will determine their long-term role in the energy mix.</p> \n<p>According to independent analysis, fuels produced from oil sands bitumen emit between 4 and 18% more CO2 (IHS CERA analysis) than the average barrel of crude consumed in the US on a lifecycle basis.</p> \n<p>Shell’s oil sands operation is already at the lower end of this scale, due to our use of mining. But we want to reduce emissions further. And carbon capture and storage technology could be one of the most effective ways to achieve this. This technology captures CO2 emissions from power stations and other industrial plants and stores them safely underground.</p> \n<p>Two months ago, Shell announced our decision to build the Quest CCS project in Alberta with our partners in the Athabasca Oil Sands project.</p> \n<p>Quest will capture, transport, inject and store more than one million metric tonnes of CO2 per annum from our Athabasca oil sands operations and store them more than a mile underground.</p> \n<p>Now, we all know that CCS technology has been slow to fulfil its potential.</p> \n<p>So Quest carries a broader significance. It can demonstrate that all the different elements required for CCS can be made to work together safely and reliably in one project: from capturing the CO2 and transporting it via pipelines to injecting and storing it in underground rock formations.</p> \n<p>In addition, Quest can serve as a model for the joint funding of demonstration projects by the public and private sectors. Such projects have struggled to secure public funding, not least in Europe. But Quest will receive a total of $865 million of funding from the governments of Alberta and Canada.</p> \n<p>Thus the project is also helping to smooth good relations between the EU and Canada, with European governments keen to learn from Quest’s experiences.</p><h2>Trade relations</h2><p>This matters, with the trade negotiations ongoing and public feeling over the oil sands running high.</p> \n<p>The Canadian federal government has already done sterling work: widening access to international investment, and improving its regulatory framework through the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Canada is currently debating the question of overseas investment in its natural resources. Suffice to say, the country’s energy sector continues to benefit from the investment and expertise of foreign investors – for example, many are involved in its proposed LNG export projects.</p> \n<p>Canada’s ability to maintain an open and attractive investment regime will have a powerful say in whether it realises the full potential of its energy resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, we must hope the European Commission takes a sensible approach to the Fuels Quality Directive. Next year, it will publish a revised set of proposals on how to create cleaner transport fuels. As it stands, the directive would discourage European companies from buying oil derived from the Canadian oil sands because of its CO2 emissions profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While the directive’s aim is laudable, singling out the oil sands is not the fairest or most effective way to achieve it.</p> \n<p>One problem is that it does not reflect the reality that there are other sources of crude whose emissions profile is higher than the oil sands. I’m talking about countries where flaring is still widespread, but which lack Canada’s transparency about their&nbsp;CO<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;emissions.</p> \n<p>Shell will continue to work with the commission and member states to try to reach a satisfactory outcome.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Let me sum up. The shared interests of Canada and Europe in the energy sector are deepening. We must all keep this in mind as the debate about the oil sands intensifies.</p> \n<p>Investment by Europe’s energy companies is helping Canada to raise its energy production and exports. That in turn will benefit Europe’s economy and strengthen its energy security. And Canada’s leadership on CCS can help the EU to meet its environmental aspirations.</p> \n<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>",

It takes a heady mix of self-confidence, faith and risk-taking determination to write a book.&nbsp; No less of an authority than John Steinbeck once said, “The profession of book-writing makes horse-racing seem like a solid, stable business.&quot;</p> \n<p>Indeed, the decision to write a book is almost always a gamble.&nbsp; There is no guarantee your words will be published.&nbsp; Even if they are, there is always the fear your book will quickly end up in that most humble of literary destinations: the discount bin at Wal-Mart.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, tonight’s finalists need not fear the discount bin.&nbsp; All have done a masterful job of accomplishing the award’s goal of “providing compelling and enjoyable insights into modern business issues.”</p> \n<p>As one of the judges, I must confess this was a most difficult decision.&nbsp; All are deserving of this recognition.&nbsp; As I considered my decision, it occurred to me that unlike so many popular business books of the past, these books focus little on strategies and how to lead.</p> \n<p>Instead, each in its own way addresses the difficulty of dealing with a rapidly changing world.&nbsp; Some common themes were the interactions between business and society, and how to balance our social values with a well-functioning market economy.</p> \n<p>When I speak here of a rapidly changing world, I’m talking not only about the business world, but of the larger world around us.&nbsp; Whether we are addressing technology, the economy or our political institutions, the rapid pace of change is forcing us to consider new ways of dealing with the global challenges ahead.<br />&nbsp;<br />That is what I would like to discuss tonight.</p> \n<p>How do we manage these changes and effectively address our global challenges?&nbsp; How do we balance society’s needs with business needs?&nbsp; And can our political institutions address the big issues of the day in a rational, intelligent way?</p> \n<p>Perhaps that last one is not a fair question to ask in the final week of a presidential campaign!&nbsp; <br />It does seem politicians at times debate the wrong questions.&nbsp; And they tend to avoid action on the toughest issues, particularly in an election year.&nbsp; I can assure you this, unfortunately, is not just an American phenomenon.</p> \n<p>There clearly are major global issues we need to begin addressing soon.&nbsp; But before I go there, it’s useful to take a look at where we are.</p><h2>The state of the world</h2><p>We have entered an era of far greater economic volatility and cyclicality.&nbsp; This, in turn, is generating more political volatility and the perception of greater investment risk.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To use a popular clich&eacute;, this is “the new normal.”&nbsp; It is a lot like this unpredictable weather:&nbsp; You never know how bad it’s going to get, so you had better be well-prepared for the next big storm and not take any undue risks.</p> \n<p>We have been through the deepest global economic slump in 70 years, which has tested the resiliency of our institutions and of capitalism itself.&nbsp; It’s a bit surprising to realize that August marked the fifth anniversary of the crisis in global financial markets.&nbsp; Five years and we are still quite far from a full recovery.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, the global economy remains surprisingly weak.&nbsp; One reason is our economy has evolved into an increasingly interdependent system – a system in which domestic policy, even in the largest economies, is shaped by global developments.</p> \n<p>In addition, slow growth and high unemployment in much of the world have contributed to more divisive politics.&nbsp; And that, of course, works against more cooperative regional and global solutions.</p> \n<p>In the short term, the world faces three big political uncertainties:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li> The euro zone crisis; </li> \n <li> The transition of power in China; </li> \n <li> And the U.S. election. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>On top of that, we have the ongoing volatility in the Middle East and North Africa, where the political uncertainty continues to affect the global economy.</p> \n<p>So that is the state of our world at the moment:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li> A painfully slow recovery; </li> \n <li> Businesses sitting on a large amount of cash, reluctant to invest;&nbsp; </li> \n <li> And a lot of uncertainty and pessimism … driven in part by an increasingly divisive and paralyzed political culture. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Have I depressed you yet?&nbsp; I do promise to share some optimism in a moment!&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But it is important to acknowledge the way we are dealing with our regional and global problems generally is failing.&nbsp; We seem increasingly ill-equipped to deal with change and the big issues of our day.</p> \n<p>In the past, there was effectively a “triangle of trust” between government, business and civil society, which helped us tackle the great issues.&nbsp; Today that triangle of trust is broken.</p> \n<p>The quality of interactions within the triangle has been steadily declining for years, and it is time we come to terms with that fact.</p> \n<p>For the future challenges the world faces are complicated and global in scope.&nbsp; They cross borders.&nbsp; They potentially affect all of us. They will require far more collaboration between government, business and civil society – not less.</p> \n<p>For example, how will we transition to a more sustainable energy system while meeting growing demand?&nbsp; How will we reduce CO₂ emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change? How will we avoid overstressing our resource systems – including water, energy and food – as we add another 2 billion people to our population by mid-century?</p><h2>New approaches</h2><p>Long-term, there is no easy answer to these questions.&nbsp; But we have some choices to make now,<br />and we know the turbulence ahead will only worsen the longer we delay action.</p> \n<p>New approaches are needed.&nbsp; We need to find ways to get past the political and economic paralysis that is thwarting progress.</p> \n<p>Some even argue that in a more turbulent world we need to lower our expectation for continuous economic growth.&nbsp; They say it is unrealistic to expect ongoing economic growth, because productivity growth could very likely decelerate over the next century.</p> \n<p>I’m not sure I buy that.&nbsp; But change and volatility do tend to cause us to question many of our assumptions, which is good.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Amid all this pessimism, I do believe there is reason for optimism.</p> \n<p>It is important to remember this:&nbsp; We are facing some of these issues only because of the unprecedented progress the world has made through globalizing the economy over the past few decades – progress that has seen an estimated 2 billion more people rise into the middle class.</p> \n<p>That is a tremendous achievement for humanity and shows what is possible.</p> \n<p>In addition, the democratization of information and communication technology, such as the rapid spread of the mobile phone, is changing lives on a global scale – especially in developing countries.</p> \n<p>So how do we deal with this new environment? How do we begin to mitigate the increasing stresses this progress is generating, while still growing the global economy?&nbsp; And how do we build a global movement for change so we can actually make progress?</p> \n<p>I am afraid I don’t have all the answers.&nbsp; If I did, I might be one of those politicians running for office!&nbsp; But I do have a few thoughts.</p> \n<p>In a volatile world, there’s a greater need to develop “resiliency” into our systems.&nbsp; By that, I mean the capacity of business, economic, political and social structures to adapt and grow in the face of change and volatility.</p> \n<p>Businesses and governments that excel in the future will do a better job developing options to deal with unanticipated crises: From political upheavals to natural disasters to technological change.</p> \n<p>To address the trust issue, we need to be more transparent in how we operate.&nbsp; The need for business to listen is far greater today.&nbsp; We also need to do a better job of explaining what we do and why.</p><h2>Transparency in Alaska</h2><p>Here’s an example of what I mean:&nbsp; As you may know, this fall Shell began initial exploratory drilling for potentially vast oil and gas resources far below the shallow waters off Alaska’s coast.</p> \n<p>I just was up there last week.&nbsp; And I can tell you first hand, this is a region of tremendous beauty, opportunity and extremes:&nbsp; an extreme environment, with extreme resource potential and extreme oversight.</p> \n<p>To deal with the environmental extremes, we are utilizing our technical know-how and the latest drilling and spill-prevention technologies.&nbsp; Our preparations have been unprecedented.&nbsp; Our Alaska plans are arguably the most heavily scrutinized in our industry’s history, and our actions are being closely watched.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alaska’s remoteness and sensitive environment warrant extraordinary precautions. So does the proximity of indigenous peoples who subsist off the land and water.</p> \n<p>Just as important as our technical preparations, is the way we have behaved as a company.&nbsp; We recognized early on that it was critical to listen and learn.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over the past several years, Shell took part in more than 500 meetings with people and organizations in Alaska to better understand and address their concerns.&nbsp; Through these discussions, we learned a lot.&nbsp; And we changed our plans.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, we cut our drilling program in half over concerns we were moving too fast.&nbsp; We committed to leave the area during the drilling season while Alaska Natives conduct their whale hunts.</p> \n<p>By simply being open about our plans, by being respectful, by listening and responding, we have gained the support and trust of the people who will be most affected by our development, including some who initially opposed it.</p><h2>Role of business</h2><p>I also believe business needs to take a larger role in exploring new forms of partnership and collaboration, with governments, with interest groups and NGOs, and with businesses outside our own industries.</p> \n<p>There are several reasons why this makes sense.&nbsp; First, government agencies and elected officials are constrained by their jurisdictional boundaries and short election cycles.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Second, industry generally has a longer-term view and a more international perspective and reach.&nbsp; In energy, for example, we often make large investments that can span over 30 or 40 years.</p> \n<p>Third, each business and industry tends to have a limited focus on its role within the overall economic value chain.&nbsp; So partnership and collaboration among businesses is also essential.</p> \n<p>This mismatch in boundaries and time frames between industry and government inhibits progress in responding to change and dealing with our long-term challenges.&nbsp; The regulatory capability of the public sector also could benefit from the private sector’s technology, innovations and project skills.</p> \n<p>So it makes sense to develop more effective ways to bring these parties together, to create new forms of collaboration that are integrated and&nbsp; influential.</p> \n<p>Again, there is reason for optimism.&nbsp; Some work already is under way to create new forms of collaboration that could restore the triangle of trust.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, there has been an ongoing dialogue about one of the issues I mentioned earlier:&nbsp; the challenge of effectively managing our energy, water and food systems as we add 2 billion more people to the global population by 2050.</p> \n<p>Our industry uses a lot of water to produce the energy we develop and the fuels and chemicals we produce; utilities use a lot of it to generate electricity.&nbsp; This will increasingly become an issue as the world’s demand for water grows with the rising population and ever-larger cities.</p> \n<p>It’s also a big issue for the food and agriculture industries.&nbsp; That’s because an even larger amount of water is needed to grow and get the food we eat to our tables.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we’ve been working to understand how the world’s energy and water systems are interconnected.&nbsp; Our goal is to do a better job of developing energy resources in ways that limit the impact on the water system.</p> \n<p>Recently, we have brought together a small group of CEOs who have committed their companies to joint projects that may demonstrate what can be done to mitigate these kinds of resource stresses.&nbsp; The idea is to find practical ways to make local economies and resource systems more resilient.</p> \n<p>What is interesting about this initiative is it involves companies from different industries, not just the energy industry.&nbsp; We want to identify what works, then replicate it elsewhere and create new business opportunities.</p> \n<p>We recognize actions are more persuasive than mere talk, which is why we have not really talked much about this initiative yet.&nbsp; It is still in its early days, and we want to wait until we have some positive results.</p> \n<p>Another example of an effort to rebuild trust within the triangle is the Energy for Society Principles.&nbsp; This is an initiative of the World Economic Forum to help accelerate the effort to meet our future energy needs by restoring society’s confidence in our industry.</p> \n<p>The goal is to focus our industry around a set of principles to foster open and transparent communication, to increase understanding and more collaborative action.&nbsp; Shell CEO Peter Voser and 19 other energy company CEOs around the world have already signed on.</p> \n<p>In the big picture, these are relatively modest efforts.&nbsp; But perhaps it is the accumulation of collaborative efforts like these, which cross traditional boundaries, that will grow into a movement and larger-scale success.</p> \n<p>In fact, this “bottom-up” approach may be more viable and build more momentum in the long run, given the obvious failure of ambitious “top-down” approaches in recent years.</p> \n<p>One final thought I’d like to add:&nbsp; If we are going to meet our future global challenges, leaders in both business and government will need to develop certain critical traits.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The old ways of doing business and governing are unlikely to get us where we need to go.&nbsp; In this new era, leaders need to be humble enough to want to see through the eyes of others, and understand what drives them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They need to be wise enough to recognize their success depends on accommodating the interests of others.&nbsp; They need to be far-sighted enough to distinguish trends and real disruptions from everyday volatility.&nbsp; And they need to be resilient enough to tackle the inevitable challenges of a turbulent world.</p> \n<p>My guess is those who succeed in this regard will likely be the subjects of award-winning business books in the future.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, we in business need to be willing to experiment more and accept that at times we will fail.&nbsp; We need to accept that some ideas by themselves will not generate profits immediately. <br />And we may need to move forward on promising initiatives even without the proper policies and incentives in place.</p> \n<p>There is a great opportunity for global business leaders to restore the trust necessary to address these global challenges.&nbsp; It is also our responsibility to help address these issues, to help break through today’s gridlock so we can continue mankind’s long march toward greater prosperity.</p>",

          "summary": "<p>Speech given by Peter Rees, Legal Director, Royal Dutch Shell plc, at the KPMG Forensic Annual Law Lecture 2012 on September 25, 2012.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>It is 30 years since ET – The Extra Terrestrial was first released and broke all box office records.</p> \n<p>The storyline is simple. An alien gets stranded on Earth and is protected by a child, who understands the good in him, against the forces of authority, who are innately suspicious, even aggressive towards him. Eventually, he gets to go home without being harmed.</p> \n<p>The film encapsulates our equivocal relationship with extra terrestrials; we either love them or hate them. They are either benign or threatening – and most of the time it is the latter. The assumption we tend to have is that extra terrestrials are out to destroy us.</p> \n<p>My first experience of extra terrestrials was in the early to mid-sixties. Some of you may be old enough to remember the television series, My Favourite Martian. It featured a friendly Martian who gets stranded on earth and is protected by a good hearted reporter against the forces of authority, who are innately suspicious about him. Sound familiar?</p> \n<p>But so far as I was concerned this was an extra terrestrial who was kindly and unthreatening. He had various unusual powers. He could raise from his head two retractable antennae. He could become invisible, read minds and lift things up into the air using just his finger. He could slow time down or speed people up. But, fundamentally, his motivation for doing these things was beneficial rather than malign. He was a nice guy.</p> \n<p>At the same time, in fact in the very same year that My Favourite Martian was first broadcast – 1963 – another television series was launched which portrayed extra terrestrials in a very different light. It has become the longest running science fiction television show in the world. It is of course Dr Who where, by and large, the extra terrestrials are portrayed as aggressors out to destroy humanity. So far as we are concerned, the Daleks have only one thing on their mind – “Exterminate”.</p> \n<p>30 years on from ET and almost 50 years on from My Favourite Martian and Dr Who, another ET has come into sharp focus in my mind. Not ET standing for extra terrestrial, but ET standing for extra territorial. And I have to say that, like extra terrestrials, there seems to be equivocation as to whether extra territoriality is a force for good or evil. Whether these are powers that can be used for overall benefit or whether they will always lead to harm.</p> \n<p>So, what I would like to examine this evening is where we are on extra territoriality, the extra territorial application of law, whether what we have done so far is helpful or harmful, beneficial or misguided, and look at what we could think of doing in this area to address some serious and urgent issues that might well benefit from extra territorial legal treatment.</p> \n<p>Let me start by going back to basics.</p> \n<p>Laws are enacted by sovereigns, by those who have sovereignty over their subjects, by those, to put it bluntly, who have the ability to tell others what to do and the means to enforce it.</p> \n<p>It may not be popular in these days of protocols, guidelines, principles and codes but unless you have the ability to enforce you don’t have the ability, effectively, to legislate.</p> \n<p>Ordinarily, therefore, you have the ability to legislate over those within your sovereign territory or over those who claim the right to have an affiliation to your sovereign territory – the quid pro quo for which is that they have to do what you say.</p> \n<p>Put differently, and arguably more elegantly, over those within your jurisdiction.</p> \n<p>Let me give you a more authoritative view than mine. That of the UK and Dutch governments.</p> \n<p>“In relation to claims of a civil nature, the bases for the exercise of civil jurisdiction under international law are generally well-defined. They are principally based on territoriality and nationality. The basic principles of international law have never included civil jurisdiction for claims by foreign nationals against other foreign nationals for conduct abroad that have no sufficiently close connection with the forum State.</p> \n<p>It is clearly established that the basis for jurisdiction is always grounded in a sufficiently close nexus to the forum State. The only exception is universal criminal jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is axiomatic that the exercise of civil jurisdiction by a State will always depend on “there being between the subject matter and the state exercising jurisdiction a sufficiently close connection to justify that State in regulating the matter and perhaps also to override any competing rights of other States.”</p> \n<p>International law imposes the requirement of a sufficiently close nexus to the forum asserting jurisdiction, in order to minimise conflicts between States and to prevent forum shopping by plaintiffs and defendants rushing to obtain judgments in a forum that favors their own interests.”</p> \n<p>Whilst extra territoriality has come to be viewed as an attempt to legislate over those outside your jurisdiction, that is not the original concept. The original concept was one of exception. That certain persons and objects could be within the territory of a sovereign but outside the reach of the law of that sovereign, or at least certain aspects of it. In other words, on your territory but extra territorial.</p> \n<p>Whilst the concept was first propounded in the 17th century it was first put down on paper, at least on paper which had any legal effect, in the Act Preserving the Privileges of Ambassadors in Great Britain in 1708. That legislation paved the way for the sorts of diplomatic immunity we are all now familiar with around the world.</p> \n<p>In common, and increasingly, legal, parlance, however, extra territoriality has come to be associated with legislative attempts by one nation to control the actions of persons, whether individual or corporate, in another nation. Jurisdiction over the legal person, individual or corporate, no matter how tenuous, and no matter how that is established, is used to seek to dictate the actions of that person within the sovereign territory of another nation.</p> \n<p>Indeed, we are moving into a world where some think that nations should be able to dictate the actions of persons in other sovereign nations notwithstanding they have no actual, or legal, jurisdiction over those persons and to force those over whom they have jurisdiction to break the laws of other sovereign nations.</p> \n<p>These are the issues which I would like to consider this evening. There are many aspects which I could cover and which I regularly encounter, but time dictates I use a few examples to demonstrate the broader problems.</p> \n<p>So, I will start by looking at some misconceived extra territorial legislation, in other words at some of the attempts that are being made to impose obligations on persons to act in contravention of the laws of another sovereign nation and look at whether this legislation is actually addressing the problems which it is professing to solve. I will then go on to look at some extra territorial problems which need to be addressed now by legislation but which are not being tackled because they are in the “too difficult” box.</p> \n<p>Before doing that I would just like to put a fairly simple proposition to you.</p> \n<p>If somebody not from your country commits a crime against somebody not from your country in another country, i.e. not your country, should the courts in your country have any jurisdiction over the issue?</p> \n<p>Or put more specifically, if a British security guard, employed by a British private security company, wrongfully detains, punches and injures, or even kills, a British anti-capitalist demonstrator during a riot in London, should that security guard, or the security company, be liable to be sued in the United States?</p> \n<p>There is one piece of legislation which might be used to try. It is what has come to be known as the Alien Tort Statute. A piece of legislation passed in the 1790s after a French diplomat to the USA was insulted by another Frenchman and then had his walking cane tapped on the street by that same Frenchman.</p> \n<p>In the last 30 years, 120 claims have been brought in the US against corporations under this statute with the average length of case exceeding five years. It is probably the most notorious piece of so called “extra territorial” legislation in existence at present and so, at the risk of boring you all, I thought I should read to you the full text of the statute.</p> \n<p><strong>Alien Tort Statute </strong>“The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.”</p> \n<p>That is it. That is all there is to it.</p> \n<p>The view of most governments outside the US is that it doesn’t have extra territorial application. That is apparent from the quotation I just read from the UK and Dutch governments.</p> \n<p>The US government agrees. It says “[American Courts] should not create a cause of action that challenges the actions of a foreign sovereign in its own territory, where the [sued party] is a foreign corporation of a third country that allegedly aided and abetted the foreign sovereign’s conduct.”</p> \n<p>The views of the UK, Dutch and US governments I have read out are as expressed in their amicus briefs in the Kiobel case which is due to be heard by the US Supreme Court next Monday. Whilst there is much that could be said about extra territoriality in the context of the Alien Tort Statute and that case, I will defer to the Supreme Court on that issue and say no more on the topic of the ATS this evening.</p> \n<p>Instead, I would like to turn to some extra territorial legislation which, in a misguided attempt to prevent a particular evil, corruption, and in an equally misguided attempt to encourage greater accountability of governments to their people, will actually succeed in encouraging the former and have no impact on the latter, but which will, in its implementation, at worst cause companies to break the law of other countries in which they operate and, at best, break the contracts they have entered into with those countries.</p><img src=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-rees.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Rees\"/><h2>Financial transparency reporting</h2><p>The English barrister, F.E. Smith, who later became Lord Birkenhead, Lord Chancellor of England and Winston Churchill’s closest friend, was known for his incisive wit and precision of expression. In one case, having made lengthy submissions to a judge who was clearly struggling with the complexities of the dispute he was interrupted by the judge saying: “Mr. Smith, I have listened to you now for an hour and I am afraid I am none the wiser” to which Smith immediately responded “No wiser my Lord, but much better informed”.</p> \n<p>There is a move afoot, coming originally out of the US but which has now spread to Europe, to force companies from the extractive industries (basically oil &amp; gas companies, mining companies and forestry companies) to publicise the amount of money they pay to governments for the right to extract&nbsp; natural resources from those countries.</p> \n<p>Why? So the people in those countries can see how much money their government is receiving for the resources it is allowing to be extracted.</p> \n<p>Why would people want to know? Because then they can hold their governments to account for the money received. Some even say (and as I have already said, this is totally misguided) it will reduce corruption.</p> \n<p>It all sounds both laudable and innocuous when put in this way, but, as with all legal issues, the devil is in the detail and what is being proposed won’t achieve either aim. People in those countries won’t be any the wiser as to how much money their government is receiving and corruption&nbsp; won’t be reduced – if anything it will increase the potential for it.</p> \n<p>Before I go on to explain why, it is time for a commercial break. So let me spend 30 seconds telling you about Shell.</p> \n<p>Shell’s oil and gas production is around 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p> \n<p>Shell, with 43,000, has more branded retail sites than McDonalds has restaurants.</p> \n<p>And if you look out of your seat window before your next flight takes off, you might well see a Shell truck pumping jet fuel in to your plane – just one of the 7,000 aircraft we refuel at over 800 airports in 40 countries each day – one aircraft being refueled every 12 seconds.</p> \n<p>What may be less obvious is the Shell fuel and lubricant flowing into the ships we service in more than 500 ports around the world or the almost 20 million tons of Shell chemicals that go into products we all use every day from detergents to packaging, from carpets to computers.</p> \n<p>Shell employs around 90,000 people. But that is only our directly employed workforce. If you add the over 400,000 people working in Shell badged franchises and operations and the half a million or so contractors you will find on Shell sites, you are looking at the best part of 1 million people working for or with Shell at any one time.</p> \n<p>If you add to that some financial information like our $1.1 billion annual spend on Research and development,&nbsp; the $32 billion capital expenditure planned for this year alone and over $40 billion annual operating expenditure you might be thinking that all I am doing is bragging about our size – but let me place it properly in the global context. For all Shell’s size, the actual portion of the world’s oil and gas we produce amounts to less than 3% of global production (2.2% in 2011).</p> \n<p>And if you add Exxon, Chevron, BP and Total to us, the so called supermajors of the oil and gas world account for no more than around 11% of what the world produces on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>Please remember that percentage now that the commercial break is over. So, let me take you back to financial transparency legislation and explain, first, why people won’t know how much their government is receiving. This can be done&nbsp;in four sentences:</p> \n<ol> \n <li> By definition, the only corporations this legislation can apply to are companies subject to US and European jurisdiction </li> \n <li> The biggest oil and gas companies in the world are (as you now know from the commercial break) not subject to US and European jurisdiction; they are the National Oil Companies and quasi national oil companies from Russia, China, Asia Pacific, South America and the Middle East. </li> \n <li> These companies no longer operate in their own back yard, but they are not caught by this legislation and there will be no disclosure of what governments are receiving from them for extractive rights. </li> \n <li> So, the amount a government receives will not be revealed by this legislation – in fact, in many cases, just a fraction, just the tip of the iceberg, with the consequence that the less well informed in a country will be misled as to how much their government receives and the better informed will be just that – better informed, but none the wiser.&nbsp; </li> \n</ol> \n<p>Will it reduce corruption?&nbsp; No. This time in three sentences:</p> \n<ol> \n <li> The legislation requires you to disclose how much you paid to the government. </li> \n <li> The last time I looked, paying money to a government is not considered corrupt under any of the applicable legislation – certainly not the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act. </li> \n <li> It is corruption to bribe a government official to get a contract; it is not corruption to pay a government (even over the odds) to get a contract; that’s what governments do – sell their mineral rights to the highest bidder. </li> \n</ol> \n<p>What it will do, however, is cause massive competitive harm to those companies which are subject to the legislation plus create the potential for increasing corruption on the way. Let me put it this way.</p> \n<p>You are from a country not caught by the legislation, so you and the government official that you are talking to about a concession to extract minerals, both know the following:</p> \n<ol> \n <li> You know what the competition are likely to bid (because they have had to publish what they bid for previous, similar, concessions); </li> \n <li> You know that what you pay will never have to be revealed </li> \n <li> You know that neither you, nor the government official, is caught by the US or European anti-corruption legislation </li> \n</ol> \n<p>I leave you to draw your own conclusions on the impact on competitiveness of US and European corporations as well as on corruption.</p> \n<p>Now, let me be clear, this is a law lecture and I am talking from the perspective of someone analysing the application of legislation generally. Lest there be any doubt I do want to reassure you that Shell is not against financial transparency reporting – quite the contrary. Earlier this year we published the total amounts we paid to most governments in 2011. We did this in advance of any mandatory requirements coming into effect in order to demonstrate our commitment to disclosure of revenues paid to governments. We believe it is important that companies like ours are open regarding how much we pay to governments and we also believe governments should be encouraged to be open about what they receive and how they spend it.</p> \n<p>I said earlier the principle is laudable. People should know what their governments receive for rights to extract natural resources.</p> \n<p>But they should get the full picture, and the only entity in the position to provide people with the full picture is the government.</p> \n<p>Of course, when it comes to legislation against corporations, governments are first in the queue – but when it comes to being accountable themselves, it seems it is a different story.&nbsp; They are much less enthusiastic to disclose the full amount they receive in revenues from oil and gas. Although there are some governments who do, like Nigeria and Norway, it is interesting that the proponents of this legislation, the US, and those seeking to copy it, the Member States of the European Union do not. As I say, interesting.</p> \n<p>Nigeria and Norway are Compliant Members of the EITI –the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - which encourages governments to disclose and verify all amounts they receive from all entities that extract their natural resources. Shell is a founder and board member of the EITI and firmly believes that the EITI’s multi-stakeholder approach (which includes governments, NGOs, regulators, the public and companies) remains the most effective way of providing transparency regarding government revenues for resource dependent countries.</p> \n<p>This way, the people of those countries get the full picture and not a distorted or partial one. They will be both better informed and wiser.</p> \n<p>But that does not seem to be direction in which we are heading. Instead, we have governments which are not willing to tell the public what they receive in oil and gas revenues pushing through legislation which forces US and European companies to disclose what they are paying, not just in total to governments around the world, but for each individual project. All this in the name of transparency (which it won’t achieve) and prevention of corruption (which it won’t achieve and may encourage).</p> \n<p>But where is the legal problem? Legislation is legislation and whether you like it or not, you have to comply.</p> \n<p>Well, I have talked about governments not being willing to publish what revenues they receive, but there are many which go further. They either require you to enter into contractual confidentiality agreements so you won’t disclose what you are paying them, or they even make it a criminal offence to do so.</p> \n<p>Therefore,&nbsp; to comply with the legislation the US is bringing in, and the EU is proposing, means that companies have to disclose information which they are either contractually or criminally forbidden to do. To be legal in one country they have to be illegal in another.</p> \n<p>It is not as if this hadn’t been thought about and debated with the legislators. Nevertheless, the US legislation says you must publicise and it is not a defence that to do so would be illegal in another country.</p> \n<p>What happened to not creating a cause of action that challenges the actions of a foreign sovereign in its own territory?</p><h2>Where extra territorial legislation is needed</h2><p>I mentioned at the start, the ambivalent view we have of extra terrestrials. Some of them are good, but the majority are evil and bent on our destruction. And you may well be thinking that I have only one view of extraterritorial legislation – it is evil and bent on our destruction. So let me hasten to reassure you that is not the case. Quite the reverse, in fact. Extra territorial legislation can be a real force for good, but it has to be directed in the right way and targeted at the real extra territorial problems the world faces today.</p> \n<p>I am going to look at a couple of examples where extra territorial legislation is urgently needed but first, by way of introduction, let me take you back to another TV programme that focused on extra terrestrials – Star Trek. I am sure most of us can clearly remember the opening lines of every episode – “Space – the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise, to boldly go…. and split infinitives….. where no man has gone before.”</p> \n<p>But so far as the law is concerned, there is no need to go extra terrestrial to deal with final frontiers, there are two frontiers that need dealing with here on earth, that are really crying out for extra territorial legislation. Extra territorial in a real sense – beyond the territory of any sovereign nation. The first of those frontiers has been around for a long time but now has a problem that we all thought had gone away without the need for extraterritorial law.&nbsp; That problem has, however, come back with a vengeance and urgently needs a legal solution. The frontier in question is the high seas and the problem is piracy.</p><h2>Piracy</h2><p>In an article in 2008 in the Wall Street Journal entitled “Why don’t we hang Pirates anymore”&nbsp; the columnist said:</p> \n<p>“By&nbsp; the 18th century, pirates knew exactly where they stood in relation to the law. A legal dictionary of the day spelled it out: &quot;A piracy attempted on the Ocean, if the Pirates are overcome, the Takers may immediately inflict a Punishment by hanging them up at the Main-yard End; though this is understood where no legal judgment may be obtained.&quot;</p> \n<p>The article continued:</p> \n<p>“Severe as the penalty may now seem (albeit necessary, since captured pirates were too dangerous to keep aboard on lengthy sea voyages), it succeeded in mostly eliminating piracy by the late 19th century -- a civilisational achievement no less great than the elimination of smallpox a century later.”</p> \n<p>Of course, we don’t hang pirates&nbsp; any more – and I hasten to add I am not advocating that we should. But the fact of the matter is, today, no one really has a clue what to do with them.</p> \n<p>There is no international body empowered to try pirates and imprison them and nobody wants to take pirates captive and take them back home because you cannot try them unless the vessel subject to the pirate attack was under the flag of your nation . Not surprisingly trying pirates is not the sort of growth industry that flag countries like Panama, Bermuda and the Marshall Islands are wanting to rush into.</p> \n<p>Jurisdiction is the issue and&nbsp; the&nbsp; problem with piracy is that, by definition, it has to happen on the high seas (in other words outside any state’s jurisdiction) and if you can’t hang them, you can’t imprison them and you can’t take them back to shore you have a real problem. Not just a practical problem but a legal one.</p> \n<p>But why should I, as Legal Director of an energy company, be concerned about this?</p> \n<p>Oil, oil products, petro-chemicals and LNG are shipped around the world and with Africa sitting between Europe and the Middle East and Asia there is very little choice but to go either through the Suez canal, down the Red Sea and out into the Indian Ocean or down the west coast of Africa. In 2010 and 2011 there were roughly 15 pirate attacks each month on vessels in the Indian Ocean, or on transit there, of which about one-fifth were successful. Attacks off the coast of West Africa ran at about seven per month in those two years.</p> \n<p>What can we do to resolve the problem?</p> \n<p>You are probably familiar with the old story of the two men walking down a trail in the woods who meet a bear. One looks to the other and says “What should we do?” To which the other responds “Run!”. “Don’t be ridiculous,” says his companion, “We can’t run faster than a bear”. To which his companion replies as he sets off at full pace&nbsp; back down the trail “No, but I can run faster than you”.</p> \n<p>That is a bit like it is with pirates. The slow oil tankers and LNG vessels cannot run faster than the pirates, so they have to make themselves harder to attack than the next boat. That was all well and good when all that involved was higher seaboards, putting razor wire round the boat or having water cannon, but when some of the vessels starting carrying armed soldiers or guards then a whole different set of legal considerations come into play.</p> \n<p>What legal considerations apply to arming vessels? What is the attitude of the nations under whose flag these vessels sail? What liabilities will they incur if a fatality occurs during a pirate attack? What is the attitude of the vessels’ insurers? Are the insurance provisions violated? Will it mean they can deny insurance claims?</p> \n<p>What will the attitude be of the countries of which the armed guards are citizens if they are killed or if they kill or injure someone? And what if that someone isn’t a pirate but an innocent bystander such as a crew member caught in cross-fire or a passing fisherman?</p> \n<p>To what extent can getting consent from the flag country and insurers give you some protection? To what extent can drawing up detailed rules of engagement for armed guards provide safeguards if there are subsequent injuries or fatalities?</p> \n<p>Where can criminal charges be brought? Which countries will have jurisdiction over civil claims?</p> \n<p>I have just asked a dozen legal questions there, to which there are no definitive answers.</p> \n<p>Given these, and the many other imponderables involved, what advice would you give when the question arises: others are arming their ships what should we do? How do we fulfill any duty of care we may have to the crews of our vessels? Are we in breach if we don’t arm; do we put them in more danger if we do?</p> \n<p>These are no longer hypothetical questions. These are real, global legal issues. By way of illustration, let me mention four incidents that have taken place this year.</p> \n<p>In the first, two Indian fisherman were killed by Italian navy personnel on duty on an Italian flagged oil tanker as the vessel was sailing along the Indian coast. It appears they mistook them for pirates and shot them dead.</p> \n<p>India arrested the two Italian marines. In response, Italy accused India of breaching its territorial jurisdiction by arresting the marines in international waters.</p> \n<p>On 24 April Italy announced that it had paid $380,000 to the families of two Indian fishermen and that this was a gesture of goodwill and not an admission of responsibility for the deaths.&nbsp; In response, the relatives of the dead fishermen have agreed to withdraw their cases against the marines, but the Indian state involved has not dropped its own charges against the two men and they are still awaiting prosecution in India.</p> \n<p>The second incident involves the Danes, once known as a marauding, pillaging and piratical nation themselves.</p> \n<p>It seems these days, however, the Danes are taking the fight to the pirates. Again, however the myriad complications I have already outlined are raising serious legal issues.</p> \n<p>In February, Danish Naval Forces opened fire on a suspected pirate ship when it refused to stop. Two hostages being held by the pirates were killed. It appears they were killed by the pirates, but would they have been killed if the Danes had not attacked? The consequences that will flow from this incident remain to be seen.</p> \n<p>The same Danish warship, the Absalon, stopped another pirate ship in early April. No one was killed or injured but the report on the incident from Reuters said:</p> \n<p>“…the suspected pirates will remain held aboard the Absalon until Denmark determines if it can hand the pirates over to a country in the region for prosecution.”</p> \n<p>The report continued to highlight some of the issues I have already mentioned:</p> \n<p>“Although anti-piracy operations have succeeded in reducing the numbers of vessels and hostages taken in the past few years, efforts to stamp out piracy are hampered by the unwillingness of many countries to prosecute captured pirates in their courts.</p> \n<p>The problem of finding courts to try pirates stems partly from a lack of a functioning judicial system and prisons in Somalia, but also reluctance by other countries to receive captured pirates.</p> \n<p>Most European countries, including Denmark, have been unwilling to bring suspects from east Africa to their jails and courts, which means navies engaged in anti-piracy missions often must release captured pirates without prosecution.”</p> \n<p>The problem is not going away or getting any easier. On 4 August 2012 an oil services vessel was attacked 60km off the coast of Nigeria, two Nigerian naval personnel were killed and four crew members (of Malaysian, Iranian, Thai and Indonesian nationality) were abducted. Jurisdictional issues multiplied by four.</p> \n<p>At the last count, as a result of piracy in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea there were 11 vessels and 206 hostages being held with average crew ransoms running at $5.4 million with a maximum reached this year of $13 million.</p> \n<p>Hanging pirates eliminated them last time round but shooting them is not the solution this time. We desperately need some effective, enforceable, extra territorial legislation.</p> \n<p>My second and final example of where we desperately need extra territorial legislation is one where there is a proliferation of domestic national legislation but the problem with nations is that we are all different. There is no uniformity of approach.</p><h2>Cybercrime</h2><p>Financial Times – 31 August 2012 -</p> \n<p>“Qatar’s RasGas, one of the world’s largest producers of natural gas, has become the second major state-owned Middle East energy company to be hit by a severe computer virus in weeks.</p> \n<p>The disruption came after Saudi Aramco, the government-backed company that is the world’s largest crude oil producer, was also attacked by a computer virus.</p> \n<p>Saudi Aramco said in a statement on Sunday that it has restored its “main internal network services” after the attack on August 15. But oil traders in Houston, Geneva and London on Thursday said they were communicating with Aramco’s counterpart by fax and telex, as the company’s external email services were still down.</p> \n<p>“It’s like going back 20 years in time,” a trader said about the use of the telex.</p> \n<p>Aramco on Thursday said it had “restricted” access to some external systems as a precaution, and referred to its previous statement issued on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The rare pair of attacks has caused concerns among energy traders and Western diplomats, as they are the first known cyber assaults targeting Middle East companies that are key to the world’s oil and natural gas supplies.</p> \n<p>Cyber attacks have grown in prevalence in the Middle East, particularly during the last 18 months of political unrest in the region. Iran has accused the US and Israel of attacking its atomic programme with two sophisticated viruses, dubbed Stuxnet and Flame, that infected computers at several nuclear plants. Tehran earlier this year also said the computers of its national oil company had been attacked.”</p> \n<p>These attacks are manifestations of what has been termed cybercrime.</p> \n<p>There is no precise definition of cybercrime but, fundamentally it encompasses illegal activities utilising the internet.</p> \n<p>Though cybercrime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities, it can be generally divided into five categories:</p> \n<p>Intrusive Offences, <strong>which include hacking, data espionage and data interference; </strong></p> \n<p>Content-related offences, <strong>including pornography, propaganda for things such as racism and spam; </strong></p> \n<p>Copyright and trademark-related offences <strong>such as piracy of software, music or movies; </strong></p> \n<p>Computer-related offences <strong>which include identity theft and credit card fraud; and so-called </strong></p> \n<p>Combination offences <strong>encompassing such things as cyberterrorism and cyberlaundering.</strong></p> \n<p>So, with so much crime going on in this other extra territorial area, cyberspace, you would think that the powers that be in this world would do something about it. The fact of the matter, however, is that whilst there are some very strong national laws, there is nothing joined up, which means enforcement, in particular is a real issue.</p> \n<p>Let me mention just one example to make the point. It involves two individuals, Reomel Ramores and Onel de Guzman. They wrote a computer virus called the ILOVEYOU bug. There was nothing loving about this virus as it caused an estimated $5.5 billion worth of damage causing even the Pentagon and the CIA to close down their computers to exterminate the bug. However, although Ramores and de Guzman were arrested in the Philippines they had to be released as there was no legislation criminalising the writing of malware in the Philippines.</p> \n<p>As you can see, some countries take this more seriously than others, but even in countries which do take cybercrime seriously, resources can be a real issue.</p> \n<p>Time to bring in the United Nations or some other multi-government organisation, I hear you cry – and you would be right. But the problem is that whilst many inter-governmental organisations are aware of the issue, the focus seems to be on talk rather than action.</p> \n<p>The UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in April 2010, in what has been described as an important breakthrough, Member States agreed to explore ways of universal regulation to counter cyber-crime. A UN Resolution was adopted. What did it propose by way of action?</p> \n<p>It made a proposal to establish “an open-ended intergovernmental expert group to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime and responses to it by the Member States, the international community and the private sector, including the exchange of information on national legislation, best practices, technical assistance and international cooperation, with the view to examining options to strengthen existing and to propose new national and international legal or other responses to cybercrime.”</p> \n<p>Talk not action.</p> \n<p>And what did another multi-partite body, the Organisation of American Sates do in recognition of this resolution? Well, in February 2012 they called upon the member states to respond to the questionnaire that will be distributed by the open-ended intergovernmental expert group on cybercrime, convened pursuant to United Nations General Assembly resolution.</p> \n<p>Two years after the UN Resolution and we are still talking about filling in questionnaires.</p> \n<p>You may surprised to hear that there does actually exist a European Convention on Cybercrime which was co-drafted in 2001 by the Council of Europe together with the US, Canada and Japan. However, although it was signed by all 46 member states there are still a significant number of countries which have not ratified it – and the UK is one of them.</p> \n<p>We really do need action and not just words and questionnaires.</p> \n<p>As Kofi Annan said “in the prospect of an international criminal court lies the promise of universal justice”, but without an international court or tribunal properly empowered to deal with cybercrime the problems and the criminals will simply proliferate.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It is these real and urgent extra territorial problems that should be the focus of government legislation and which could enable governments to be a real force for good, rather than focusing on ineffective legislation such as the financial transparency legislation which meets short term political aims but not the long term interests of people in resource rich states. Real global leadership is needed in the area of extra territoriality, leadership with a view to creating structures to enforce the rule of law for generations to come rather than with a view to winning the next election.</p> \n<p>I said at the beginning that to legislate effectively you need the ability to enforce and in conclusion I would add that you should be able to enforce without infringing the sovereign rights of other nations to control what happens within their jurisdictions and with their people.</p> \n<p>Careful thought has to be given to the impact of any form of legislation which has extra territorial effect.</p> \n<p>As I also said at the start, like extra terrestrials, there is equivocation as to whether extra territorial legislation is a force for good or evil. Whether these are powers that can be used for overall benefit or whether they will always lead to harm.</p> \n<p>There are clearly extra territorial areas, true extra territorial areas, (piracy and cybercrime are but two) where much good could be done by governments cooperating to produce effective means of enforcing, extra territorially, the rule of law. In such cases extra territorial legislation can be the force for good.</p> \n<p>ET – extra territorial legislation - can be the friend rather than the alien. But If we are not careful we can end up passing legislation which is not a force for good – which is alien rather than friend - and the problem is, it may take us rather a long time to realise the real effects of some of this legislation – to realise it is alien. And as someone memorably said:</p> \n<p>“If you can see the aliens in the UFO, it's already too late.”</p>",

The world will be adding the equivalent of a city the size of Edmonton or Dallas… every week for the next 30 years.</p> \n<p>Every one of those cities… every one of those people… will need energy to survive -- never mind to thrive. The global demand for energy could grow by a third by 2030… and some 50% higher than today by the middle of this century. And even while that energy is vital to human survival, producing it puts enormous pressure on environments and social fabric in every corner of the globe.</p> \n<p>My company alone invests about 30 billion dollars every year in working to close that gap between supply and demand.</p> \n<p>The industry globally will spend untold trillions over the next four decades to find, develop and produce ever more challenging sources of energy – from traditional oil and gas, to shale gas, to liquids from shales, to – eventually – advanced biofuels, hydrogen and other renewables.</p> \n<p>But we’re working the demand side as well. At Shell our Downstream businesses are developing and marketing ways to help customers use less of our product. That sounds counter-intuitive, I’m sure, but it’s actually good business. Our markets will increasingly demand not just energy resources... but the technologies, infrastructure, policies and consumer behaviors for using those resources more efficiently.</p> \n<p>In short, both sides of the energy equation – supply as well as demand -- present enormous opportunities – not just challenges – especially for Canada and America.</p> \n<p>And this is where Asia comes into the story.</p><h2>Asia: the lion’s share of growth</h2><p>Much of the foreseeable growth in energy demand will come from Asia. Roughly half of the demand increase will come from China and India, with the majority of that from China. Southeast Asia, traditionally an energy exporting region, also expects to double its energy demand in that time horizon.</p> \n<p>And by 2030 Chinese demand could be more than one-and-a-half times as high as the next-largest energy consumer – the United States.</p> \n<p>China is at an obvious crossroads in its development.</p> \n<p>At the extreme: One path points to an unsustainable, carbon-intensive energy future that will create economic uncertainty and instability in the years ahead. Neither China nor the world can afford this path… and Chinese leaders know that.<br />The other end points to a historic opportunity to move toward a more sustainable energy system… maybe even to leapfrog some of the elements of the development history in the West.</p> \n<p>It’s true that coal still drives much of their energy growth today; but Chinese leaders are famous for taking the long view. They know they need cleaner, more sustainable ways to fuel their continued economic growth. They are making capital investments and policy decisions to that end.</p> \n<p>An important example of that – important especially for Canadian and American leaders – is China’s focus on natural gas… a cleaner option to almost any other energy source available at scale today.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>China has said it will more than double natural gas as a percentage share of its primary energy use by 2015. It could triple by 2020. We at Shell see China driving 50 percent of the world’s growth in natural gas demand over that same period of time.</p> \n<p>To meet these demand projections, China is looking to expand its domestic natural gas production and import natural gas by pipeline from the Caspian region.</p> \n<p>But it will also need liquefied natural gas – or LNG – imported from even further abroad.</p> \n<p>Demand for LNG across Asia – including China – is likely to grow by more than 80 mpta between now and 2020. This is equivalent to another Japan, which imported a record 83 million metric tonnes of LNG in 2011, following the tragedy at the Fukushima nuclear plant.</p> \n<p>What’s even more significant is that most of that growth is for commercial, industrial and residential needs. When China decides to ramp up construction of natural gas power plants, the number could be REALLY eye-popping.</p> \n<p>You can see where I’m going here.</p><h2>Charting a way forward with investment, innovation & imagination</h2><p>LNG exports to Asia can open a market for North America – and especially Canada – worth billions of dollars. It could sustain investments, jobs and provide long-term income through royalties and taxes here, while helping China and the rest of emerging Asia secure a lower-carbon energy future there.</p> \n<p>Alberta and British Columbia alone are probably sitting on more than 200 trillion cubic feet of competitive natural gas. Natural gas production from tight shale and sandstone in the U.S. and Canada nearly doubled between 2005 and 2010.</p> \n<p>Shell is at the forefront of developing these cost-effective resources in sustainable ways on both sides of the border.</p> \n<p>But we’ve also seen what’s happened to natural gas prices in such a market.</p> \n<p>Ready supplies across North America leaves western Canadian suppliers on the fringe of an over-supplied market.</p> \n<p>How can we create more value with that supply?</p> \n<p>By going west. By becoming the supplier of choice for Asian customers looking for long-term clean energy security.</p> \n<p>Of coure we in North America aren’t the only ones in the world to come up with that idea.</p> \n<p>Australia already exports around 26 mtpa of LNG to Asia, and the Aussies have plans on the table for up to 80 mtpa. Countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Qatar are developing opportunities for their own natural resources and have the advantage of being just around the corner from the Chinese market.&nbsp; So even as long term global demand for energy will sky-rocket, we’re seeing intense competition and a short window of opportunity now in key energy markets.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So how do we – on both sides of our border – realize that opportunity? How best can we compete?</p> \n<p>I suggest a policy recipe with three ingredients: investment, innovation, and imagination.</p> \n<p>Investment is the obvious one. Companies like mine are investing billions in exploring, producing and developing energy sources in North America – including natural gas.</p> \n<p>But it will take many billions more to fully realize the value of those resources: investments in LNG terminals… pipelines… LNG carriers… power grids… local infrastructure… and education and training for the workforce required in Canada’s case to close the expected shortage of skilled workers in our industry over the next decade.</p> \n<p>The payoff is clear. Huge GDP impacts and revenue for health care… for education… for public works… for economic development.</p> \n<p>All this is not just idle speculation.</p> \n<p>Last month, we at Shell announced our aspiration to develop an LNG export facility near Kitimat in British Columbia. Along with three Asian partners the project would design, construct and operate a plant that will produce 12 million tonnes of LNG each year – the equivalent of 15 percent of Japan’s projected imports for 2012… and the equivalent of all of China’s LNG imports in 2011.</p> \n<p>Our planned investment in BC depends on a careful study of environmental impacts… dialogue and input from local communities… and thorough but efficient work by regulators on approvals and permits. It also depends on additional private and public investment in the infrastructure needed to supply the facility: pipelines, power, people and more.</p> \n<p>But we’re excited about the possibilities there. And we’re hoping we’ll be up and running around the end of this decade.</p> \n<p>Of course investment will only get so far without innovation to go with it.</p> \n<p>And here I’m thinking not only of technology innovation -- although there are plenty examples of that: innovation, for example, required to operate LNG export terminals in 7 countries… with a fleet of 53 LNG ships… we participate in ventures that supply some 30 percent of the world’s LNG … all safely and reliably. Also the technical innovation required to produce this region’s massive gas reserves, previously locked away in deep rock and shale.</p> \n<p>I’m also thinking of non-technical innovations. Ways of addressing the needs and expectations not just of markets but of people and communities.</p> \n<p>For example, last year we at Shell broke new ground – intellectual ground, not just geological ground – by introducing what we call our Onshore Gas Principles.<br />These are a set of commitments we’ve made to satisfy not just regulators… and not just critical stakeholders… but to satisfy ourselves that we are doing everything possible today to ensure the safety and integrity of our exploration and production of energy from gas.</p> \n<p>We see these principles not as a self-imposed constraint on our ability to operate… but rather as way to make sure we compete and lead in a market that will never stop demanding more safety… more environmental responsibility… more respect for communities and people.</p> \n<p>But innovation does not just happen in companies. It happens in government as well. Canada is actively driving an efficient regulatory framework that recognizes both the opportunities and challenges of 21st century energy… one that continues to ensure close scrutiny and high standards for operations… but that also eliminates wasted time and bureaucratic delays. Some are calling the proposed framework “one project, one review.” It could reduce years of delay in realizing revenue and investment opportunities.</p> \n<p>A modest proposal might be for U.S. regulators to consider a similar framework.</p> \n<p>And I see this kind of thinking as a source of competitive edge for our entire region’s energy industry.</p> \n<p>Which brings me to imagination.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Imagination in this context means combining investment and innovation in ways that position Canada and North America as the gold standard for clean, responsible, lower carbon and competitive energy – its consumption as well as its supply.</p> \n<p>Let me offer an example from another part of the energy system. The Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada have signed a letter of intent formalizing their decision to contribute a combined total of $865 million to Shell’s Quest Carbon Capture and Storage project… that’s “CCS” for short.</p> \n<p>Quest is a fully integrated CCS system, meaning it would capture, transport, inject and permanently store more than one million metric tonnes of CO2 per annum more than a mile deep underground. This CO2 will come from our oil sands operations.</p> \n<p>That’s an important development being watched closely by governments like China’s, which wants to reduce its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 17 percent, and which is hand-cuffed to high carbon coal as an energy source for the next few decades.</p> \n<p>With the Quest project, Canada and Alberta are sending a message to the world that they want not only to be an important source of energy, but that they have the imagination to be public partners and leaders in investing in low carbon innovations.</p> \n<p>As an integrated oil company – one that operates along the entire value chain from remote well heads to millions of customers in your local neighborhoods – we work in imaginative public and private partnerships that look at how energy is used, as well as how it’s produced.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fuels and lubricants, for example, that improve the efficiency of your family car… asphalts that can be laid at lower temperatures and therefore with less energy… biofuels that offset some of our dependency on fossil fuels and help reduce the carbon emissions from transport.<br />And with the region’s gas resources firmly in mind: We are making good progress in looking at ways to use LNG as a transport fuel. It is competitively priced against diesel and results in less harmful emissions. Last September, Shell made a decision to invest in our first LNG-for-transport venture in Alberta – providing LNG fuel for heavy-duty transport vehicles.</p> \n<p>Just this morning we announced a memorandum of understanding with TravelCenters of America to sell LNG to heavy-duty road transport customers in the US through TA’s existing nationwide network of full-service fueling centers.</p> \n<p>Pending final agreements, the proposed plans include constructing more than 200 LNG fuel lanes at about 100 sites throughout the US interstate highway system. If a final agreement is reached, the first of the LNG fuel lanes are expected to become operational in 2013.</p> \n<p>As a global company, with partnerships in almost every corner of the world, we also have the ability – I’d almost say the obligation – to join up imaginative ideas across boundaries… intellectual and political boundaries as well as geographic boundaries.</p> \n<p>China leaps to mind again.</p> \n<p>Part of helping China realize the value of safe and secure energy imports from North America lies in partnering with them to realize the value of their own resources.</p> \n<p>So in China, we are developing tight gas resources with China National Petroleum Corporation, helping to expand supplies of this cleaner-burning fuel. Together we are pursuing the Changbei project, exploring for gas in Sichuan Province and working on a coal bed methane project in Shanxi Province. CNPC is also an equity partner in our Groundbirch gas project in Canada.</p> \n<p>And we’re cooperating on R&amp;D and technology. That includes development of advanced seismic technology and a new joint venture to develop an innovative, highly automated well manufacturing system to boost gas production at lower cost and with a smaller footprint.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By working with China and its energy companies on projects like these, we will not only create new investment opportunities… but also promote a global energy infrastructure based on shared best practices and smart technologies.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope it’s clear that Shell sees the North American region not only as critical source of growth and opportunity, but as a leader in tackling the world’s energy challenge.<br />Our two countries will irritate each other from time to time over issues like the Keystone XL pipeline.&nbsp; But those issues will always get resolved.</p> \n<p>What’s more important is that I see few other cross-border partnerships in the world that bring to bear the same combination of investment, innovation and imagination to powering global progress… and by doing so, secure economies, environment and futures at home.</p> \n<p>That’s the responsibility we all share.&nbsp; It’s why more than 90,000 of us come to work every day at Shell.&nbsp; And it’s why I applaud the work of Canadian American Business Council.</p> \n<p><em>Thank you very much.</em></p>",

The “natural gas revolution” is the most significant energy development in decades.</p> \n<p>Today I want to share with you my view on the global implications of this revolution, with a particular focus on what it means for Asia.</p> \n<p>As you know, our industry in the past decade has developed and perfected the technology needed to unlock gas from places previously assumed to be out of reach. As a result, natural gas will be a far bigger player in meeting our future energy challenge than we had previously assumed.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that this year Shell expects to produce more natural gas than oil for the first time in its history.</p> \n<p>The benefits of natural gas in meeting our future energy needs are well-documented. Its supply is increasingly abundant and diverse, which means greater energy security. It is a clean-burning ally to renewables like wind and solar. Generating electricity from gas also requires relatively low capital investment. And it’s highly flexible. It can be converted to liquid fuels, transported easily, and used to make other products.</p><h2>North American experience</h2><p>In North America, we have already seen the dramatic impact of the gas revolution. New reserves of tight gas, shale gas and coal seam gas are helping the United States rebuild its economy and become more competitive.</p> \n<p>Combined with increased oil production from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially huge deposits in the arctic, and the growth in tight oil and heavy oil – including oil sands – North America is looking at a dramatically improved outlook for energy security.</p> \n<p>Gas holds considerable promise in the rest of the world as well. In fact, the International Energy Agency estimates total worldwide recoverable gas resources at 250 years at current production.</p> \n<p>Australia, for example, holds large-scale deposits of coal-seam gas, while some estimate China’s shale gas resources could be as much as 50% larger than those in the United States.<sup>(*)</sup> South Africa, Indonesia and India also hold significant deposits of shale and coal-seam gas.</p> \n<p>But it is China and Australia that are most likely to see the next wave of this revolution. China’s potentially enormous deposits could play a major role in helping boost the share of natural gas in its energy mix, and easing its dependence on coal.</p> \n<p>Shell is proud to be working with China National Petroleum Company on several projects to tap these resources. They include the Changbei tight gas field in Shaanxi Province, which supplies gas to Beijing and other cities in eastern China.</p> \n<p>While there’s no doubt these abundant gas reserves around the world can be tapped, society should not underestimate the substantial investment and highly complex technology required to do so in a safe and responsible way.</p><h2>The need for regulation</h2><p>Indeed, there has been vocal opposition among some environmental groups regarding the potential safety and environmental effects of developing these resources.</p> \n<p>This has resulted in some misconceptions about the impact of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking” – a technique that has been tried and tested over many years.</p> \n<p>One area of concern that has attracted more recent attention is greenhouse gas emissions – especially methane – from shale gas production. We know methane releases can be significantly reduced by using proven technologies.</p> \n<p>For example, at our Pinedale operation in the US state of Wyoming, we installed a system to help us stop methane leaks detected with an infrared camera. But clearly more research is needed to understand the true extent of methane releases from the gas industry.</p> \n<p>In general, our industry needs to do a better job of listening and responding to these concerns. To that end, Shell last year announced five operating principles for our onshore shale and tight sand oil and gas operations. And just last week, the International Energy Agency issued its “Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas”.</p> \n<p>The IEA rules were developed in consultation with policymakers, the industry, regulators and NGOs to provide practical recommendations for the development of these resources.</p> \n<p>We welcome the IEA’s effort. Its recommendations and principles are similar to our own. They provide a framework for protecting water, air, wildlife and the communities in which our industry operates.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we are committed to support regulations consistent with our operating principles. Our hope is they can be applied over time to all tight oil and gas operations around the world.</p><h2>An expanding global LNG market</h2><p>Of course, we cannot discuss the natural gas revolution without mentioning the spectacular growth of the global and regional LNG markets, and the implications for this growing region.</p> \n<p>LNG has a long history here, with Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei all serving as long-term suppliers. Further exploration should continue to yield new opportunities for these countries.</p> \n<p>Thailand has become an LNG importer, as well, and several other ASEAN countries are preparing to do so, including Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. This is one reason why global LNG demand is expected to double in the next decade.</p> \n<p>The growth in global suppliers of LNG and its flexibility advantage were brought into sharp relief after the devastating earthquake in Japan one year ago. To cover the immediate shortfall in Japan’s energy suppliers, LNG cargoes were quickly diverted from countries around the world, including Russia, Australia, Korea and Nigeria.</p> \n<p>Today Japan is investing heavily to lock in LNG supplies to replace its nuclear generating capacity.</p> \n<p>Strong demand growth is possible in part because global liquefaction capacity has increased by around 40% over the past three years. Much of that increase has come from Qatar, which has become the world’s largest LNG supplier.</p> \n<p>This is great news for Asia, as about 40% of Qatar’s LNG is reserved for Asian markets through long-term contracts. And we expect an increasingly diverse group of suppliers will supply the Asian market, providing access to gas reserves around the world.</p> \n<p>Australia eventually could rival Qatar as an LNG exporter. It has more than a half-dozen LNG projects planned or under construction.</p> \n<p>Then there’s North America. Its tight-gas production boom means it no longer needs major LNG imports. That has freed up supplies for Asia and Europe. It also means we will likely see a growing LNG trade across the Pacific from Canada, the world’s third-largest gas producer.</p> \n<p>Just last month, Shell and our Asian partners announced plans to develop an LNG export facility in western Canada.</p> \n<p>Asia should further benefit from the LNG industry’s latest technological innovation when we start to produce and liquefy natural gas at sea. Our first Floating LNG facility will develop our&nbsp;Prelude gas field off Australia’s northwest coast.</p> \n<p>Our ambition is to build more FLNG vessels to tap other offshore fields that would otherwise be too costly or difficult to develop, including those in Asian waters.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is governments in Asia and elsewhere have every reason to back natural gas as a secure and sustainable energy source, and every reason to make the most of their domestic gas resources.</p><h2>The cleaner fuel for development</h2><p>In this part of the world, the rapid pace of development comes with many implications – and opportunities.</p> \n<p>The growth of Asia’s megacities, with increased congestion and pollution, presents policymakers with a big challenge: How do you fuel development in an environmentally sustainable way?</p> \n<p>Asia will need to develop all forms of energy to fuel its growth. And with significant reserves in Indonesia, China, Australia and India, coal will continue to play a prominent role in generating power.</p> \n<p>But as prosperity increases, development comes with expectations of better living standards, including cleaner air. This is where natural gas can help: It is the cleaner fuel for development.<br />It is the fastest and least expensive way to reduce pollution in cities. Gas-fired power plants have significantly lower emissions of local pollutants, such as oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, mercury and fine particulates.</p> \n<p>There’s a carbon benefit to gas as well. Gas-fired generators produce between 40% and 60% less C0₂ than coal-fired power plants.</p> \n<p>In the United States, the gas boom has led to a significant drop in carbon emissions due in large part to a major shift from coal to gas in the power sector.</p> \n<p>As I said earlier, gas also is a natural ally to solar and wind power. Gas generators can be switched on much more quickly than other power sources when the wind stops or the sun doesn’t shine.</p> \n<p>And then there’s the cost: Natural gas capacity is faster and less costly to install than any other new source of electricity.</p> \n<p>When we talk about the environmental benefits of gas, it’s also important to remember that gas for power consumes a lot less water than nuclear or coal. This is becoming an increasingly important consideration in Asia, where many people still have no access to potable water, and where so much of the resource is needed for farming.</p><h2>Getting more value from gas</h2><p>One of the benefits of using gas in the energy mix is the versatility of this fuel, thanks to decades of research and development. Beyond the innovations in extracting gas from hard-to-reach places, Shell has been working hard to find other ways to gain value from this abundant resource.</p> \n<p>Cleaner-burning LNG for transportation is a great example. As an alternative to diesel, it’s another smart way to reduce emissions of sulphur-oxides and particulates.</p> \n<p>In Singapore and the Dutch port of Rotterdam, we are looking at expanding opportunities to use LNG as a marine fuel.</p> \n<p>In western Canada, Shell’s preparing to make LNG available this year to fleet operators along a busy truck route. Drawing on the region’s natural gas to produce the LNG at a small-scale gas-liquefaction plant, we believe fleets on this route could see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 20% on a well-to-wheels basis.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we are also investigating ways to use LNG as a transport fuel in the rail and mining sectors, as well as in oil and gas drilling. Natural gas can also provide a cleaner source of electricity than coal for the world’s growing fleet of electric vehicles, which would further reduce many countries’ need to import oil.</p> \n<p>Another example of the expanding value chain is gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology, which transforms natural gas into other higher-value liquid transport fuels and chemicals. Shell is a pioneer and leader in GTL technology, with a track record of research and production going back four decades.</p> \n<p>Last year, we opened the world’s largest GTL plant in Qatar. The Pearl GTL plant produces GTL gasoil – a clean-burning diesel-type automotive fuel – and GTL kerosene, which can be used for jet fuel. It also produces chemical feedstocks for lubricants, detergents and petrochemicals.</p> \n<p>We think GTL technology could make a lot of sense in other gas-rich countries as well. It would further reduce the need for imported oil while deriving greater value from natural gas resources.</p> \n<p>In summary, to meet the rising global demand for energy in the decades to come, the world must expand all available sources of energy. The natural gas revolution offers the best, most promising opportunity we have today to make substantial, immediate progress toward a more sustainable energy supply.</p> \n<p>Gas is the fuel for development. Its supply is diverse, secure and abundant. Generating electricity from gas requires low capital investment, and its flexibility makes it the natural ally to renewables like solar and wind.</p> \n<p>I’m confident innovations and further advances in technology will make natural gas even more attractive in the years to come.</p> \n<p>For countries facing an increased population and rapid urbanisation – and all the challenges that brings – natural gas is an intelligent long-term bet to fuel growth in an environmentally sustainable way.</p> \n<p><br /><em>Thank you.</em></p> \n<p><em><sup>Cited source:<br />(*) U.S. Energy Information Administration report, 2011</sup></em></p>",

In this speech to the Chief Executives Club of Boston, Peter Voser says doing so successfully will require us to be realistic, to face facts and question old assumptions.

I have spent quite a bit of time down in Texas, which is the home of our American subsidiary, Shell Oil.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But honestly, I really don’t look good in a cowboy hat, I obviously haven’t picked up the drawl, and I am not particularly fond of whiskey.</p> \n<p>I mention this stereotype because the issue I want to discuss today really demands that we question old assumptions.&nbsp; It also demands that we be realistic about where our world is heading.</p> \n<p>I want to share with you my views on the future of energy, on the impact of the American shale revolution, and what the world needs to do now to begin addressing one of the greatest challenges mankind has ever faced.</p><h2>Where we stand</h2><p>So let me start by telling you a bit about Shell and where we stand, and maybe I can dispel a few more stereotypes.</p> \n<p>Today Shell employs about 90,000 people in more than 70 countries around the world, including about 20,000 here in the United States.&nbsp; About half of our employees work every day with some of the most advanced technology in the world.</p> \n<p>In fact, last year the editors of&nbsp;MIT’s Technology Review listed Shell as one of the world’s most innovative technology companies.&nbsp; In our industry, we are a high-tech company.</p> \n<p>We believe climate change is real and time is running out to take real action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; We support governments putting a price on carbon, through such systems as cap-and-trade.</p> \n<p>And, yes, we do see a need to develop renewables like wind, solar and biofuels.</p> \n<p>We also need to make our cities more energy-efficient. And we need to keep pushing the technology to make our cars and trucks consume less fuel, and facilitate the use of alternative fuels, like electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and natural gas.</p> \n<p>At the same time, we also need to find and extract more oil and natural gas, often in more challenging, expensive locations.</p> \n<p>Now I realize that last line is what most people would expect me say. But hear me out.</p> \n<p>The fact is our global energy system is so big, our energy consumption is on a scale so massive, and demand is growing so quickly that we will need to aggressively pursue all sources of energy for decades to come -- just to keep up. When President Obama says America’s energy policy should be “all of the above,” he is absolutely right.</p><h2>The prosperity paradox</h2><p>Here are a few numbers and facts to keep in mind.</p> \n<p>Every day, our global population increases by more than 220,000 people.&nbsp; That is the equivalent of adding a city of 1.5 million -- more than twice the population of Boston proper -- every week.</p> \n<p>Here in the developed world, we do not readily see the impact of this. That’s because most of this rapid growth is elsewhere -- in China, India, Brazil and other developing nations.</p> \n<p>As the population rises in these countries, there are also millions more people each year moving up from poverty and joining the middle class.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This increasing prosperity has been a fantastic human achievement resulting from the globalization of our economy. But it also raises some global issues that promise to become more challenging for all of us to address in the years ahead.</p> \n<p>Most of these people are flocking to rapidly growing cities, where they are using more energy as they use their first appliances and drive their first cars. As a result, in the next seven years alone, the world’s additional energy demand could be equal in size to China’s entire energy demand today.</p> \n<p>This creates what we call a “prosperity paradox.”&nbsp; That is when the ongoing rise in prosperity, combined with a rapidly growing population, creates stresses that over time threaten to undermine that prosperity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These stresses are building on all of our vital systems, and our environment. The United Nations estimates by 2030 the world will need 30 percent more water, 40 percent more energy, and 50 percent more food to keep up with the increased demand. &nbsp;And that’s not far off:&nbsp; A baby born today will graduate high school in 2030.</p> \n<p>The challenge of addressing these resource needs is magnified many times by the linkages between them.&nbsp; Water is needed for almost all forms of energy production, energy is needed to treat and transport water, and both water and energy are needed to grow food.&nbsp; And the potential effects of climate change will influence all three.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To successfully address these challenges, governments, business and society at large need to address them intelligently and in unison.</p><h2>Shell Scenarios</h2><p>At Shell, we spend a considerable amount of time analyzing these kinds of trends so we can get a better handle on the future and make better decisions. It is critical, really, because unlike most other businesses, our investment decisions can take 10, 20 or even 30 years to pay off.</p> \n<p>For the past 40 years, our scenarios team has had the mandate to look toward the future with an independent, unbiased eye.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The future is neither completely predictable nor completely random.&nbsp; The scenarios can at least give us the tools to anticipate what might happen and allow us to understand our options. In other words, they deepen our strategic thinking. And we share this thinking with governments, researchers, academia and the public.</p> \n<p>In our latest report, the scenarios team analyzes how economic, social and political forces might play out through this century, and how those forces could affect the evolution of our global energy system.</p> \n<p>On your tables you’ll find copies of the report, titled “New Lens Scenarios.” It goes into far more depth on each of the two scenarios than I can here, so I encourage you to take it home and dig into it. It’s fascinating reading.</p> \n<p>Here are a few highlights from the report.</p> \n<p>By 2035, both scenarios anticipate the world’s renewable energy sources growing by at least 60 percent, or even double.&nbsp; Yet in each scenario, fossil fuels are still likely to meet about 60 percent of global energy demand by 2060.&nbsp; That’s because, as I noted earlier, demand is expected to grow so sharply over the next 50 years.</p> \n<p>And the 60 percent figure is still down significantly from about 80 percent today.</p> \n<p>One of our scenarios foresees a world strongly shaped by market forces, in which oil, natural gas and coal continue to play a major role, as do renewables after 2030. But in this scenario, action to address climate change comes slowly. As a result, coal use continues to rise for decades with a resulting rise in CO₂ emissions.</p> \n<p>In another scenario, the world is strongly influenced by government policies and the abundance of natural gas. Gas becomes the most important energy source globally by the 2030s. This is combined with coordinated global efforts to limit CO₂ emissions, such as government support for carbon capture and storage technology.</p> \n<p>Again, these are scenarios, not predictions. The direction we take will depend largely on decisions being made now and through the coming decade. And as you may have guessed, there is no silver bullet.</p><h2>The American shale revolution</h2><p>Fortunately, there has been some very positive news on the energy front in recent years, news that has the potential to help ease the transition to a more sustainable energy system.</p> \n<p>Here in North America, the energy outlook is much different from what it was just a few years ago as a result of the “American shale revolution.” &nbsp;And it is already having an impact on the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>Combined with increased oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, the potential for major deposits in the Arctic, and the growth in tight oil and heavy oil -- including oil sands -- North America’s energy picture is much brighter.</p> \n<p>Improvements in the technology known as hydraulic fracturing are unlocking huge volumes of oil and gas.&nbsp; And this technology has the potential to do so elsewhere around the world as well.</p> \n<p>The United States has led the world in developing this technology and is already reaping the benefits of its deployment, in terms of greater energy security, economic growth and jobs.</p> \n<p>As recently as 2008, North America was facing the end of natural gas self-sufficiency. Prices soared and plans were made to build import terminals for liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Today those plans have been mothballed, prices are down by two-thirds and there is discussion of LNG exports.</p> \n<p>As a low-priced fuel and chemical feedstock, natural gas and gas liquids have the potential to revitalize America’s heavy industry and open up new markets in transportation. Now there is talk of the United States becoming energy self-sufficient by 2030.</p> \n<p>As production of American shale oil increases, traditional oil suppliers to the United States are diverting cargoes to new markets. And because utilities have been switching to natural gas from coal to generate electricity, CO₂ emissions are down significantly.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, according to U.S. Energy Information Agency data, natural gas has displaced nearly 10 percent of the coal used to generate electricity in the U.S. over the past two years.</p> \n<p>And where is that coal going?&nbsp; To Europe!</p> \n<p>There is a certain irony here:&nbsp; Cheap U.S. coal is replacing cleaner-burning natural gas in Europe. Coal, of course, produces far more CO₂ than natural gas. So despite a major, costly push to subsidize and develop renewables, Europe’s CO₂ emissions were actually up last year, while here in America, they were down.</p> \n<p>Which is more proof that government policy, or the lack of it, sometimes has unintended effects.</p> \n<p>In Europe, there has been far less enthusiasm among policymakers for natural gas. Which to me does not make a lot of sense, because gas is the natural ally of renewables like wind and solar.</p> \n<p>The fear among some is abundant natural gas will hinder the advance of renewables. But gas has a strong role to play as a backbone fuel as the renewable industry develops.</p> \n<p>Wind and solar are intermittent energy sources. Natural gas can keep the electricity flowing when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind fails to blow. Unlike many other energy sources, gas can be switched on and off quickly. And its global supply is increasingly diverse, which enhances energy security.</p> \n<p>So Europe is finding out that getting the energy mix right is crucial. If you invest in renewables to lower greenhouse gas emissions, but then switch from natural gas to coal to make up the difference, have you really improved anything?</p> \n<p>Much of Europe is also believed to hold shale resources. But some countries have been reluctant to explore for them. And with no strong government policy direction in favor of natural gas, utilities have been reluctant to invest in new plants.</p> \n<p>France has even banned hydraulic fracturing due to environmental concerns.</p> \n<p>The reality is hydraulic fracturing has been performed more than 1 million times over the past six decades in the United States alone. Documented instances of freshwater contamination have been extremely rare. When a well is designed and constructed correctly, groundwater will not be contaminated.</p> \n<p>That said, our industry needs to work with governments to do a better job of addressing these concerns. Strong regulations and tough enforcement are needed to ensure all operators drill shale wells properly and protect groundwater and the environment. Shale development must be done in a demonstrably responsible way to gain public support.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we also support regulations to disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, and to promote transparency and public engagement by the shale gas industry in relation to all its activities. Here in the United States, we already publicly disclose our fracturing fluid chemicals through the FracFocus online registry, to the extent allowed under our supplier contracts.</p> \n<p>As I said, the shale revolution does have the potential to go global. Some reports suggest China may have considerably more shale gas than the United States. Exploration is under way there to determine its potential.</p> \n<p>China, like the United States, has an abundance of coal, but is also looking for cleaner alternatives as it deals with its rapid growth and increasing pollution.</p> \n<p>But the growth of shale resources globally is by no means certain. The technologies, skills and policies needed for this revolution to take hold outside North America will need to be transferred and developed.</p> \n<p>So what are the geopolitical implications of the American shale boom?</p> \n<p>The abundance of natural gas and affordable prices are already giving the American chemical industry and energy-intensive manufacturing a global competitive advantage. Countries and regions that fail to adopt a strategy to utilize their own shale gas resources could find their manufacturing industries on the losing end.</p> \n<p>The situation with oil is more complicated. The same technology that has led to the gas boom is being used to free up oil trapped in shale. As a result, the United States will likely import far less oil from the Middle East over the next two decades.</p> \n<p>But most analysts expect the United States will still need to import. And it will still have an interest in ensuring global energy security.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One reason is there is limited refining capacity in the U.S. for light oil. This means some oil will need to be exported and other crudes will continue to be imported to accommodate the refining infrastructure. Overcoming this imbalance will take time and considerable investment.</p> \n<p>But there are other practical, strategic reasons for the United States to remain engaged in the region. The European Union and Japan are key political allies who will continue to be highly dependent on Middle Eastern oil. China is expected to become more dependent as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Because the oil market is global, any major disruption to the flow of oil in any region would affect the global and U.S. economies. So it is hard to see a scenario in which the United States abandons its interests in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no doubt the shale revolution has been good for North America and its economic recovery, and that it has altered the region’s energy picture favourably.</p><h2>Conclusion: what needs to be done</h2><p>But the American shale revolution alone will not get us on the road to a cleaner and more sustainable global energy system. So, in summary, what needs to be done?</p> \n<p>First, the world needs to follow America’s lead and take full advantage of the cleanest-burning fossil fuel: &nbsp;natural gas. The International Energy Agency estimates there is enough technically available natural gas globally to last 250 years at today’s consumption levels.</p> \n<p>Increased use of natural gas is the biggest single step the world can take today to begin reducing CO₂ emissions. In generating power, natural gas produces about half the CO₂ emissions of coal.</p> \n<p>As I said earlier, gas is the natural ally to renewables. And its supply is increasingly diverse, which enhances energy security.</p> \n<p>Second, governments must support development of carbon capture and storage technology to make fossil-fuel use cleaner. This is critical to take CO₂ out of the power sector over the next 50 years. It can help meet the demand for cleaner energy at a time when renewables are still being deployed on a relatively small scale.</p> \n<p>But the technology remains in the early stages of development. It needs major financial support and strong mandates around the world to get off the ground.</p> \n<p>Finally, all governments need to promote more effective, efficient urban planning and transportation. There is a tremendous opportunity for good planning to moderate the growth in energy demand, especially in the swelling cities of China, India and other high-growth nations.</p> \n<p>It’s simple, really:&nbsp; Cities with higher population density are more energy-efficient than sprawling cities. They encourage people to use public transport and drive less. Widespread development of more compact cities offers savings on average of 2-thousand kilometres per person annually in car use, compared with the low-density development common in many parts of the world today.</p> \n<p>Intelligent urban planning could transform the global transport system over the next 50 years, by providing the infrastructure for cars and trucks powered by electricity, hydrogen and natural gas. The increasing use of LNG in trucking and marine transportation here in North America is an excellent example.</p> \n<p>Substantial efficiency gains should be targeted in other areas as well. These include retrofitting homes and commercial buildings, optimizing energy use in the heavy and petrochemical industries, and redesigning our transportation systems.</p> \n<p>But for these things to happen, we will need far-sighted government policies and far more collaboration between governments and businesses. I don’t need to tell you this is something that generally has been lacking in the West.</p> \n<p>In fact, China has been perhaps the most pragmatic and far-sighted in setting energy policies to prepare for a future in which demand will soar. China has set clear goals with a view towards ensuring a cleaner, more diverse and sustainable energy system.</p> \n<p>We know the scale of the challenge ahead of us.</p> \n<p>We know it will require a global, coordinated and intelligent response.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The time to act is now.<br /> </p>",

Its journey via the Suez Canal to Bangkok and Singapore was the first carried out by a bulk oil tanker. These tankers sharply increased the volume of oil products that could be transported, sparking a revolution in the international oil trade and, eventually, the global economy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fast forward 120 years and Shell is again growing its presence in South-East Asia.<br />&nbsp; <br />That’s a great source of pleasure for me, personally. I came to know and love Thailand and the region while working here earlier in my career with Shell.</p> \n<p>I’m also heartened to see the country making a strong recovery from last October’s appalling floods.<br />&nbsp;<br />One way in which Shell is contributing is by donating some $1 million to the King of Thailand’s Chaipattana Foundation – which does such valuable work to benefit the Thai people and promote sustainable development.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last week it was announced that Thailand’s GDP grew 11% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the previous three months. That underscores the resilience and vitality of Thailand’s industrial sector.</p> \n<p>Thailand is not alone. Countries across South-East Asia are achieving some impressive growth rates, despite severe economic problems elsewhere in the world. That bodes well, as ASEAN member nations work towards a single market in 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But ASEAN’s gathering strength also brings challenges. I will briefly discuss one of the biggest: how the region can develop a supply of energy that is secure, affordable and sustainable. <br />&nbsp;<br />Let’s first step back and look at the global picture.</p><h2>Global and regional energy challenge</h2><p>Global energy demand could double in the first half of this century, driven by a rising global population and strong growth in emerging economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This economic success is lifting millions of people out of poverty. According to McKinsey, as many as three billion people could join the middle – or consuming – classes around the world over the next two decades. As a consequence, energy demand will rise sharply, as people buy their first cars, washing machines and televisions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To keep pace, the world must invest heavily in all energy sources, from oil and natural gas to biofuels, solar and wind. According to the IEA, the world will need to invest some $38 trillion to meet projected energy demand in the period to 2035. That’s $30 billion every week.</p> \n<p>Despite the recent fall in oil prices, the long-term trend is still likely to be one of high and volatile prices, as demand puts supplies under pressure.</p> \n<p>What are the implications for South-East Asia?</p> \n<p>At Shell, we think that the region’s primary energy demand could increase by around half by 2025. Its power needs will be even more acute. According to one consultancy (Wood Mackenzie) power demand in South-East Asia could triple by 2030.</p> \n<p>Yet the region also faces declining long-term production in some of its precious energy resources, notably natural gas.</p> \n<p>This should not obscure the fact that the region’s gas deposits will make a significant contribution for many years. For example, Vietnam will continue to increase its gas production, while 2011 saw major gas discoveries in Indonesia and offshore Sabah.</p> \n<p>But several of the region’s gas production areas are entering their maturity, including the Gulf of Thailand. That raises the prospect of growing dependency on imported gas, as well as oil.</p> \n<p>Thailand will import more pipeline gas from Myanmar and liquefied natural gas from elsewhere – as well as more electricity from Laos.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another factor is that the most intensive phase of the region’s economic development will happen against a backdrop of high and volatile oil prices. It will also take place amid concern about rising greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.</p> \n<p>The ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Co-operation is a strong roadmap for tackling these challenges. I see three critical steps for the region:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> First, expanding and diversifying its energy supply; </li> \n <li> Second, moderating energy demand by promoting efficiency;&nbsp; </li> \n <li> And, third, the right government policies. </li> \n</ul><h2>Expand and diversify the regional energy supply</h2><p>So my first priority is for the region to expand and diversify its energy supply.</p> \n<p>Clearly, renewables will play an increasing role: geo-thermal power and hydro-electricity will build on their established presence in parts of the region. And biofuels are set for rapid growth across South-East Asia. Even so, fossil fuels are still expected to supply more than two-thirds of the region’s total primary energy in 2035.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What’s the best way ahead in the power sector?</p> \n<p>The prospect of nuclear power gaining a foothold in ASEAN has become more uncertain after last year’s accident in Japan – although several countries continue to ponder its merits.</p> \n<p>And with regional gas production set for long-term decline, governments are relying more on coal-fired power. This is, to an extent, unavoidable.</p> \n<p>But I would like to re-assert the importance of natural gas as a reliable and sustainable fuel for South-East Asia. As the cleanest burning fossil fuel, natural gas has clear environmental advantages. Gas-fired power plants greatly reduce emissions of pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p> \n<p>These take a terrible toll on air quality and human health in Asia. In 2007, the World Bank estimated the health cost of air pollution in China to be in the range of between 1% and nearly 4% of the country’s GDP. Gas-fired generators also typically generate 40-60% less CO2 than coal-fired power plants. And they are the natural ally of renewable energy, because they can be quickly switched on and off when the wind stops and the sun doesn’t shine.</p> \n<p>Over the long-term, carbon capture and storage technology could reduce CO2 emissions from gas-fired power close to zero.</p> \n<p>To strengthen gas supply security, ASEAN countries must be encouraged to realize the full potential of their gas resources. That means continuing to look for and develop resources in frontier areas, such as deep water fields.</p> \n<p>It also means expanding the Trans-ASEAN gas pipeline and regional power networks. This will promote economic integration, as well as a more secure and flexible energy supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, this is already a major priority for the Thai government and its neighbours. The ASEAN energy ministers have resolved to strengthen energy ties and co-operation between their countries.</p> \n<p>They also want to develop a common regional framework for the trading and marketing of oil and gas.</p> \n<p>The private sector will play an important role in realizing these aspirations. But I should emphasise that it will not be sufficient for the region to focus simply on attracting capital investment and building the physical infrastructure.</p> \n<p>ASEAN must also address complex legal and regulatory issues. These include setting common and robust regulatory standards – especially on safety – and clear guidelines for regional energy co-operation.</p><h2>Natural gas revolution</h2><p>I would also invite ASEAN governments to reflect on the remarkable expansion in the world’s gas supplies.</p> \n<p>In North America, technological advances have opened up vast new reserves of tight gas, shale gas and coal seam gas.</p> \n<p>Over the past decade, Shell and other energy companies have developed technology to unlock gas from dense rock such as shale. We use horizontal drilling and a technique called hydraulic fracturing, which pumps water under high pressure into the rock, creating cracks that allow gas to flow more freely to the well.</p> \n<p>North America may now have 100 years of gas supplies at current consumption rates. Only a few years ago, it was assumed that long-term production decline had set in.</p> \n<p>This new gas abundance has led to much lower prices for North America – providing businesses with a major competitive advantage. <br />Gas there now costs around $2.50 per million Btu, compared with a 10 year average of about $6 per million Btu.</p> \n<p>Tight gas holds much promise in the rest of the world. For example, Australia holds significant coal seam gas deposits, while China’s shale gas resources could be even bigger than those of the USA, according to a 2011 report by the US Energy Information Administration.</p> \n<p>In South-East Asia, there are deposits of coal seam gas in Indonesia, for example in South and Central Sumatra. Several companies are drilling pilot wells, with the Indonesian government keen to ascertain the potential for large-scale production.</p><h2>Liquefied natural gas (LNG)</h2><p>The tight gas revolution carries a much bigger implication for South-East Asia: it adds impetus to the expansion of the global and regional LNG market.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, LNG has a long history in the region, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei all major long-term suppliers. And now Thailand has become an LNG importer, with plans to expand the Map Ta Phut re-gasification terminal.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we regard the country as a potential LNG customer of great importance.</p> \n<p>Several other countries in the region are also preparing to become LNG importers, including Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. This highlights the region’s progress in strengthening its energy infrastructure.</p> \n<p>These countries will benefit from the rapid expansion in global LNG supplies.</p> \n<p>Last year’s tragedy in Japan highlighted LNG’s ability to match gas supply with demand as it fluctuates around the world. To cover the shortfall in Japan’s energy supplies, LNG cargoes were diverted at short notice from a range of locations, including Russia, Australia and Korea.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over the past three years, global liquefaction – or production – capacity has increased by around 40%.&nbsp; In becoming the world’s largest LNG supplier, Qatar has provided much of this increase.</p> \n<p>This is great news for Asia: about 40% of Qatar’s LNG is reserved for Asian markets, on the basis of long-term contractual commitments.</p> \n<p>This is only the beginning. An increasingly diverse group of LNG exporters will supply South-East Asia, providing access to vast gas reserves around the world.</p> \n<p>By 2020, Australia could rival Qatar as an LNG exporter. The country has around half a dozen large-scale LNG projects planned or under construction. These include projects to convert coal seam gas to LNG, making this abundant gas source exportable to Asian markets.</p> \n<p>Then there’s North America. Its tight gas production boom means that it no longer requires major LNG imports, freeing up significant supplies for Asia and Europe.</p> \n<p>North America’s enormous tight gas resources will probably now give rise to a trans-Pacific LNG trade. The US Department of Energy has granted permission for LNG exports from the country’s Gulf Coast. And the development of even half of the projects under consideration would turn the US into a significant LNG exporter.</p> \n<p>That’s not all: two weeks ago, Shell and our Asian partners announced plans to develop an LNG export facility in Canada,the world’s third largest gas producer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So South-East Asia has every reason to back natural gas as a secure and sustainable energy source, and every reason to make the most of its domestic gas resources.</p><h2>Biofuels</h2><p>What about the transport sector?</p> \n<p>Despite the promise of electric vehicles, global demand for liquid fuels is likely to rise by around one-fifth by 2030. <br />At Shell, we believe that biofuels – such as biodiesel and ethanol – are the most effective way to broaden the global transport fuel mix over this period. We expect their share to increase from around 3% today to 9% by 2030.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biofuels are also the best way to reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. For example, Brazilian sugar cane ethanol reduces emissions by around 70% compared to petrol, across the lifecycle from the cultivation of the sugar cane to using the ethanol as fuels.</p> \n<p>Thailand’s strong agricultural base is supporting a growing biofuels industry. Not only should this ease Thailand’s dependence on imported oil, it could also prove an excellent export opportunity. The government’s 15 year alternative fuel plan is an important step in the right direction.</p> \n<p>Of course, biofuels can throw up social and environmental challenges. One way we’re addressing these is by working with NGOs and others to push for international standards for the sustainable sourcing of biofuels.</p><h2>Energy efficiency</h2><p>All of which brings me to a second priority for the region: curbing its rising energy consumption.</p> \n<p>Stricter fuel efficiency standards will be crucial -- as will the construction of more efficient power stations.</p> \n<p>We must also consider the historic transformation underway across the region, as countries make the transition from rural to urban societies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>South-East Asia’s urban population has almost doubled in the past two decades: some 44% of the population now lives in urban areas. That will rise to two-thirds by 2050 (UN).</p> \n<p>This has significant implications: urban dwellers typically consume more energy than their rural counterparts, partly because they tend to be wealthier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>More positively, the shift to urban living provides opportunities to improve energy and resource efficiency. This is partly a question of scale: energy, water, and other services are increasingly managed at a city, rather than a national, level.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Careful planning and controlled urbanisation can have a major impact on future energy use.</p> \n<p>Cities with higher population density, such as Singapore, are more energy efficient.</p> \n<p>By contrast, sprawling cities in the USA have much higher levels of energy consumption. In many, per capita energy consumption for personal travel is five to ten times higher than in some developed Asian cities.</p> \n<p>Urban mass transit is another way to keep personal vehicles off the road. Bus rapid transit corridors are a cost-effective option that can handle up to 50,000 passengers an hour – nearly as many as subways.</p> \n<p>Jakarta is the first South-East Asian city to introduce such a system. The results are striking: in 2009, the Trans-Jakarta Busway was used by some 250,000 people a day, an 11% increase on the previous year. That resulted in estimated fuel savings equivalent to some $100 million.</p><h2>Policies</h2><p>All of which leads to my final point. The right government policies will be critical to meeting the region’s energy challenge.</p> \n<p>One important political issue is the subsidies that support the consumption of fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>In a global survey, the IEA identified 37 countries with estimated subsidies totaling $409 billion in 2010.</p> \n<p>Subsidies shield consumers from higher energy costs. But they also bring unintended consequences: in South-East Asia, subsidized power tariffs discourage industry investment in new energy supplies and power capacity. And, globally, subsidies simply encourage people to use more energy.</p> \n<p>The Thai government has made a strong start in reforming prices for liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas in the transport sector.</p> \n<p>But as the government contends with public opposition, we must remember the broader benefits of removing subsidies. The IEA estimates that if subsidies were phased out worldwide, global energy demand would fall 4% by 2020 and nearly 5% by 2035.</p> \n<p>The IEA also estimates that only 8% of the $409 billion in support in 2010 reached the poorest households. The agency argues that providing similar levels of financial support directly to low-income families would be far more efficient.</p> \n<p>For ASEAN countries, policy frameworks that incentivize energy investment are also important.</p> \n<p>I’m talking about stable fiscal and regulatory frameworks for investments that can run to billions of dollars over several decades.</p> \n<p>Governments around the world often respond to oil and gas price increases with tax hikes, only to leave the higher rate in place when the price weakens. This discourages investment and accentuates energy price volatility.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, Shell has a long and proud history in Thailand, including pivotal moments in the history of our industry.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Today, South-East Asia is again at the forefront of historic changes in the energy industry.</p> \n<p>To meet surging demand, the region must secure a reliable and affordable energy supply. It must also limit the environmental stresses associated with energy consumption.</p> \n<p>One step will be to expand all available sources of energy, while preserving the pre-eminence of gas as an energy source. Another priority should be to promote energy efficiency.</p> \n<p>I’m confident that Thailand will rise to the challenge with its customary dynamism, optimism and resilience.</p> \n<p>And that Shell’s next 120 years in this great country will be as happy and mutually beneficial as the first.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><br /><em>Thank you.</em>&nbsp;</p>",

At the same time, it offers the fastest and cheapest route to significantly reduce power-sector emissions of CO2.</p> \n<p>The largest growth market for natural gas is in the Asia Pacific region with its rapidly growing economy and an increasing reluctance to burn coal for power generation.</p> \n<p>Take China for example, its primary energy consumption could double by 2030 as it overtakes the US as the world’s largest energy consumer. We expect that 20% of that demand growth to be met by natural gas.</p> \n<p>Shell is the leading IOC in natural gas, and we have ambitious growth plans in LNG and tight gas.</p> \n<p>Let me take a moment to talk to you about one of our exploration projects, in Alaska.</p><h2>Alaska</h2><p>The Arctic, and especially Alaska is an important play for Shell and we plan to explore here in the summer of 2012.</p> \n<p>The board has assessed both the opportunity that Alaska exploration presents for shareholders, and the challenges that come with development in such a remote and environmentally-sensitive area</p> \n<p>This year, through increased stakeholder engagement and support, and a more focused approach on permitting we have now received the majority of the permits we need for the 2012 drilling season.</p> \n<p>The industry, including Shell, has drilled some 100 wells offshore Alaska – including some 35 in Arctic regions. In fact Shell has already drilled safely in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless we have taken additional measures to reduce risks such as adding in an additional shear ram to our blow-out preventers and building up a strong&nbsp; oil spill response capability including a subsea capping capability and an Arctic containment system.</p> \n<p>We are satisfied that your company made the right preparations to drill in this area, and I and the board are following this very closely.</p> \n<p>Let me update you on your Board membership.</p><h2>Directors</h2><p>I’m&nbsp; pleased about the positive ratings that the overall corporate governance arrangements our company receives, however we recognize that diversity on the board is an issue.</p> \n<p>In line with the Davies report, the Board expects that 25% of the board will be women by 2015. We also actively looking to recruit directors from outside of our traditional regions, such as Asia Pacific.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You will have noticed a new face on the stage with us compared to last year, Linda Stuntz who was elected at last year’s AGM.</p> \n<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald also joins the Board on July 1, 2012, subject to his election by shareholders at this AGM. He will become a member of the Corporate and Social Responsibility Committee. Among Nigel’s many accomplishments were five years as the British ambassador to the United States and three years to the European Union.</p> \n<p>Malcolm Brinded has stood down as an Executive Director as of April 1st this year after 37 years of a very distinguished career at Shell.</p> \n<p>Lord Kerr stands down at the AGM this year after 9 years as a Non-executive director, and I will come back to Lord Kerr’s retirement later.</p> \n<p>Hans Wijers will succeed Lord Kerr as Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director.</p> \n<p>And finally Josef Ackermann joins the Nomination and Succession Committee.</p> \n<p>Let me now give the floor to your company’s Chief Executive Officer: Peter Voser.</p><h2>Peter Voser – Chief Executive Officer</h2><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be here today at the 2012 AGM.</p><h2>Safety in Shell</h2><p>Let us look at the 2011 performance in Shell, first on safety. Safety is the top priority for Shell.</p> \n<p>Recent incidents such as the Gannet oil leak in the UK serve notice that we need to stay vigilant and maintain our focus on the safety of our operations.</p> \n<p>No one likes to see these incidents, but I am satisfied with Shell’s prompt actions to address them. We are investigating the causes and will look to make changes to reduce the risks in future.</p> \n<p>This industry is under intense scrutiny. However, I believe that Shell’s technical expertise, safety culture and rigorous global standards, all of which you will hear more about later, demonstrate that we are operating responsibly, no matter how challenging the conditions are.<br />&nbsp;<br />In 2011 our fatal accident rate was the lowest ever, but we still had 6 fatalities last year. Our goal is for zero fatalities and no incidents that harm our employees, contractors or neighbours, and together we have to make further improvements here.</p> \n<p>In 2011 our total recordable case frequency was in line with our best ever performance of 2010.</p> \n<p>We continue to make progress on road traffic safety, for example with a 41% reduction in incidents in 2011.</p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>Financial performance</h2><p>Let’s look at the financial performance.</p> \n<p>Our underlying CCS earnings of&nbsp; some $25 billion have increased by some 37% from 2010 and&nbsp; 115% versus 2009.</p> \n<p>We have been investing for new growth, and selling down non-core positions in upstream and downstream.</p> \n<p>Recently we announced a measured increase in dividend for the first quarter of 2012.</p> \n<p>Our TSR - total shareholder return – was around 70% over the last 3 years, a sharp increase over the prior period, and a competitive performance from Shell.</p><h2>Updating our priorities</h2><p>Let me update you on the strategic priorities, and you’ll see we are keeping the momentum on the strategic drive we have had in the company over the last few years.</p><h2>2012+ Priorities</h2><p>Continuous improvement through a relentless focus on performance is a major&nbsp; priority for the company.</p> \n<p>Then it’s about delivering on the growth projects that we have launched in the last years, and working on new options for the next wave of investment.</p> \n<p>Shareholders are investing in Shell for profitable growth, and so are we.</p><h2>Capital investment</h2><p>Our organic investment in 2011 was $26 billion, similar to 2010 levels.</p> \n<p>We’ve taken 12 final investment decisions in 2011, and 17 over the last two years.</p> \n<p>Spending on these new projects is now building up, and this will drive our organic capex to $32 billion in 2012.</p> \n<p>We’ve also taken on new portfolio options in 2011, in plays like exploration, Iraq gas, and liquids-rich shales, and increase our feasex costs...for example new LNG and chemicals options.</p> \n<p>You can see the main investments on this chart, and we are putting the priority on a series of large themes, where we can have economies of scale on technology and contracting and procurement, the right diversity of political and technology risk, and the size of portfolio we need to impact our bottom line growth.</p><h2>Key projects</h2><p>You can see some of the projects we are currently commissioning or which are under construction.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>About 80% of our current investment is Upstream, and some 60% of Upstream spending is in Australia and North America.</p> \n<p>The portfolio of projects we have underway has an oil price break-even on an NPV basis of less than $60 per barrel.</p> \n<p>These are attractive projects for our company and shareholders.</p> \n<p>I want to highlight an area of frequent discussion at our AGM, Nigeria, and in particular our onshore joint venture, SPDC.</p><h2>Nigeria</h2><p>The overall security situation in Nigeria has been improving following the government amnesty in the Niger delta in 2009. This has allowed the SPDC joint venture to ramp up production to some 800,000 boe/d in 2011 from around 460,000 boe/d in 2009.</p> \n<p>In the Nigerian onshore, the volume of operational spills decreased last year due to an increased focus on maintenance and better access to facilities, although I have to say that the number of these small operational spills trended up in 2011.</p> \n<p>SPDC made further improvement in the remediation of spill sites caused by sabotage or oil theft.</p> \n<p>In 2011 there were some 200 new spills, around 2/3rds of which were caused by sabotage or oil theft.</p> \n<p>SPDC was able to remediate and certify 351 sites in 2011, leading to a reduction in the backlog of sites needing remediation from 400 to 274 sites.</p> \n<p>There are some worrying trends however. During 2011 we started to see an increase in large scale oil theft and illegal refining. This has resulted in production stoppages and environmental damage.</p> \n<p>Sadly, this year has also seen a return to violence in some areas, with two SPDC contractors shot and killed while on an environmental survey during a remediation project.</p> \n<p>On the left you are looking at the Imo river area, specifically at some of the illegal refining operations. I visited the area myself a few weeks ago.</p> \n<p>The oil theft and illegal refining is at large scale, with tank farms, barge building operations and barges shuttling crude to waiting tankers offshore.</p> \n<p>In fact the oil theft was so prevalent we could not ensure the safety of our operation and shut in 25,000 barrels a day of production during part of 2011.</p> \n<p>SPDC was only able to re-start production after government security forces increased their presence in the area, dismantling the infrastructure put there by the oil thieves.</p> \n<p>SPDC does not take decisions like this lightly.</p> \n<p>Nigeria has some 160 million people and receives more than 95% of the revenue from every barrel of oil onshore. The Nigerian government depends on oil for some 80% of its income. For the Nigerian people, many of whom live in poverty, the cessation of any oil income has immediate consequence.</p> \n<p>Further, when production is shut in, either by choice or due to sabotage, and the pipelines depressurized, it is easier for thieves to install valves to steal from both the oil in the pipeline and when production is re-started. This perpetuates the cycle.</p> \n<p>There are estimates that in total some 150,000 barrels a day of oil and condensate is stolen in Nigeria, worth some $7 billion at current market prices, there are no easy answers here, and Shell will play its part but we need the government to play a more active role.</p> \n<p>On the UNEP report.... progress has been made on those recommendations pertaining to SPDC.</p> \n<p>SPDC has supported the Rivers state government in the provision of emergency supplies of fresh water as well as planning for a long term solution.</p> \n<p>In March, Bureau Veritas– an independent international standards verification agency – began work reviewing SPDC’s emergency spill response and initial clean up practices.</p> \n<p>In April the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) convened the inaugural meeting of an independent advisory panel that will provide scientific recommendations to SPDC to help restore the biodiversity and habitats at SPDC spill sites, as well as make recommendations for improvements to company and national standards for remediation and rehabilitation of such sites.</p> \n<p>On flaring…</p> \n<p>It is important to put Shell’s flaring into context in Nigeria. Both our onshore and offshore ventures perform well compared to the rest of industry, however we need to do more here.</p> \n<p>SPDC flared some 20% less gas in 2011 than in 2010, while increasing its oil &amp; gas production by 7% in 2011.</p> \n<p>The program to install or repair associated gas gathering equipment is beginning to have an effect.</p> \n<p>And Shell is assessing new projects for onshore Nigeria, which will add new production and reduce flaring. These projects could cost some $4 billion on a 100% basis.</p> \n<p>We expect these to be completed in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe, subject to approval by partners and the security situation, and we are nearly there with that.</p> \n<p>These are the final two projects which should allow us to reduce the flaring intensity in Nigeria to below the current global average.</p> \n<p>Now, turning to other areas of the company.</p><h2>Biofuels growth</h2><p>In 2011, with the finalization of our Brazil biofuels JV, Raizen, Shell moved for the first time into the mass production of biofuels.</p> \n<p>This joint venture manufactures some 2 billion liters of ethanol from sugarcane annually, producing significantly less CO2 on a life cycle basis than conventional fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The majority of Raizen’s sugarcane crop is rain fed and not irrigated, making the ethanol it produces less water intensive than many competing crops in different regions.</p> \n<p>We are also looking at several “next generation” biofuels technologies, in R&amp;D partnerships, some of these go ahead and others don’t work out and we move on.</p> \n<p>Sustainable biofuels should play a large role in helping to meet customers fuel demand and to limit CO2 emissions.</p><h2>Oil sands</h2><p>Turning to the Oil Sands, in 2011 we completed our 100,000 barrel per day oil sands expansion project which took total capacity to some 250,000 barrels per day.</p> \n<p>On the tailings side, last year the industry agreed to set aside intellectual property rights and cooperate on tailings research, this year a much broader collaboration has been agreed with the aim to accelerate the improvement of environmental performance across the industry.</p> \n<p>On CO2, with financial support from the Alberta and Canadian governments, we plan to capture and store about 1 million tonnes of CO2 per annum from the Scotford Upgrader using a CCS project called Quest.&nbsp; We expect to take FID on this project this year.</p> \n<p>There is a lot of focus on the emissions from the oil sands facilities, but let’s put this in perspective. If Shell’s oil sands operation were in the United States, it would be approximately the 150th largest direct emitter of Greenhouse gasses, according to EPA data. Number one is a coal fired power station with some 23 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. By comparison our oil sands operations and our in situ business together emit some 5 million tonnes a year.</p><h2>Outlook</h2><p>Turning to our future outlook, where we set new targets earlier this year.</p><h2>Updating growth outlook</h2><p>Cash flow from operations was $136 billion for 2008 to 2011 at an $87 average oil price.</p> \n<p>We are expecting cash flow from operations to be some 30-50% higher for 2012-15 in aggregate, or around $175 to $200 billion, assuming $80-$100 Brent.</p> \n<p>This outlook is underpinned by the ramp-up of the projects we have brought on stream in the last few years, and new project start-ups.</p> \n<p>Capital efficiency is an important part of our strategy, and we are expecting around a quarter of a million barrels per day of licence expiries and asset sales over the next few years. If those impacts play out, then we would expect our production to average 4 million boe per day in 2017-18, some 25% higher than 2011 levels.</p><h2>Dividend track record</h2><p>Shell has a strong track record on dividends, and dividends are the company’s main route to return cash to shareholders.</p> \n<p>Over the last 10 years, we have paid more dividends than any of our sector peer group.</p> \n<p>Including the time before unification, we have not cut our dividend for decades, and I would like to highlight that we maintained our dividend across the credit crisis years.</p> \n<p>In fact, in 2011, 1 out of 8 pounds paid in dividends on the FTSE was paid by Shell.</p> \n<p>The resumption of the measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed with the first quarter 2012 reflects the improving financial position in the company and delivery of our strategy.</p> \n<p>And with that let me hand you back to the Chairman.</p><p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cautionary statement</strong><br />The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

          "maintext": "<p><em>The petro-chemical industry has long faced many global challenges: technical, logistical, political, environmental and legal. In this speech, Shell Legal Director Peter Rees examines the scope of those challenges, and focuses on three major ones on his agenda today: Financial transparency, piracy, and contracting/procurement. In doing so, he demonstrates how the role of the corporate legal counsel has become central to resolving the major challenges facing global corporations today.</em></p><img src=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-rees.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Rees\"/><h2>Global legal challenges facing the petro-chemical industry</h2><p>Exactly 52 years ago today, in 1960, Time Magazine published a major cover story about Shell, its global operations and challenges. This is how it began:</p> \n<p><em>“Along the steaming, mud-covered delta of Africa’s Niger River, bare-chested men labored amid crocodiles and screaming parrots this week to push shafts of steel deep into the earth. </em></p> \n<p><em>“On the choppy waters of the Persian Gulf, others perched on a crablike platform and sent a snag-toothed bit boring into the ocean bed. </em></p> \n<p><em>“Around the world, hundreds of men labored just as sweatily in 35 other countries – from the pampas of Argentina to the back hills of New Zealand – to probe the earth in an eager quest for the substance that makes the world’s wheels go round: oil.</em></p> \n<p><em>“The men on the Niger, the men in New Zealand’s back hills are all employees of a single company, Royal Dutch Shell, the world’s second-biggest oil company, and by far the most international in scope, organization and spirit.”</em></p> \n<p>All that talk of steam, sweat and bare chests in exotic locales is a bit reminiscent of a bad romance novel. But I digress.</p> \n<p>The fact is today, many of the places we drill are even more challenging and remote. And these days, we willingly provide our workers with shirts. That aside, you could write virtually the same thing today, and you would still describe Shell accurately.</p> \n<p>The petro-chemical industry has long faced global challenges – technical, logistical, political, environmental and legal. The challenges get greater with each passing year on all these fronts.</p> \n<p>Tonight, I want to give you an inside view on the global legal challenges we face as the world’s second biggest energy company. Before I do, I’d like to offer a bit of context both in terms of Shell and our industry.</p> \n<p>Last year, Shell celebrated 100 years of operations here in Canada. Most people know us through the fuels and engine oils we sell around the world. That’s not surprising when you consider Shell, with 43,000 stations, actually has more branded retail sites than McDonalds has restaurants.</p> \n<p>If you look out of the window before your next flight takes off, you might well see a Shell truck pumping jet fuel into your plane – just one of the 7,000 aircraft we refuel at over 800 airports in 40 countries each day.</p> \n<p>What may be less obvious are the ships we service in more than 600 ports around the world, or the 22 million tonnes of Shell chemicals that go into products we all use every day: detergents, packaging, carpets, computers and countless other items.</p> \n<p>Shell directly employs around 90,000 people. But when you add the over 400,000 people working in Shell franchises and operations, and the half a million contractors on Shell sites, you are looking at nearly 1 million people working for or with Shell on any given day.</p> \n<p>We spend about U.S. $1.1 billion annually on research and development, and our capital expenditure averages $30 billion a year.</p> \n<p>So you can imagine that with that many people, that range of activities and that sort of spend, the legal issues we face are varied, challenging and often cutting-edge. Now, let me put those big numbers in a global context.</p> \n<p>For all of Shell’s size and reach, we produce just 2% of the world’s oil and gas. So to account for all the oil and gas produced to meet the world’s energy demand each day, you have to multiply Shell’s scale by a factor of 50. That factors in the dozens of major public and private energy companies, hundreds of service and engineering companies, and thousands of logistics companies that comprise our industry.</p> \n<p>It’s a very complex business. And the future is not going to get any simpler or easier.</p> \n<p>Consider these facts:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> In the coming years, hundreds of millions more people will emerge from energy poverty, buying their first washing machines, refrigerators, computers and cars. </li> \n <li> By 2050, our children will share this planet with 9 billion people, up from 7 billion today. </li> \n <li> That is like adding another China and another India to the world. We will be creating the equivalent of one new city with a million people every week. </li> \n <li> The energy industry globally is going to have to spend trillions of dollars over the next four decades to find, develop and produce the energy needed to meet these people’s needs. </li> \n <li> That energy will come from more challenging and expensive sources, including oil sands, shale gas, liquid-rich shales, as well as advanced biofuels, hydrogen, wind and solar. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>But the challenges go beyond allocating capital and developing more sophisticated technologies. For while energy underpins the world’s well-being, producing it also puts enormous pressure on our environment and social fabric. Resolving the tensions between these competing needs means making difficult judgments: technical, financial, legal and moral judgments.</p> \n<p>And in the way the world is moving, the legal judgments are becoming more and more entwined with the moral judgments. Hard law and soft law are getting more and more difficult to differentiate, and the industry is being held to account to both.</p> \n<p>There’s a wide range of global legal challenges facing the petro-chemical industry today, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> Extraterritoriality – nations that seek to impose their laws and jurisdictions outside traditional geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. </li> \n <li> There’s increased regulation in almost every aspect of our operations, from deep-water drilling to oil trading, from what we can and can’t say to our shareholders to how we pay our executives. </li> \n <li> There’s the interaction of the laws of states, the obligation to do something in one nation that is illegal in another. </li> \n <li> There’s the impact of politically motivated actions on the rule of law and sanctity of contract, resulting in actions such as expropriations or retrospective laws. </li> \n <li> There’s the increasingly uncertain business environment caused by the breakdown in trust between governments, corporations and civil society. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>And those just scratch the surface. There is a reason why we have more than 700 lawyers at Shell, working in more than 40 countries.</p> \n<p>In the interests of time, I want to cover just three of the major issues on my plate at the moment. I categorise them as follows:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> The one that looked insoluble, but which turned out not to be. </li> \n <li> The one that looks insoluble and continues to be. </li> \n <li> And the one that looks perfectly soluble, but which legislators are making insoluble. </li> \n</ul><h2>Financial transparency</h2><p>I’ll start with the last one, which is about the issue of financial transparency.</p> \n<p>The English barrister, F.E. Smith, who became Lord Chancellor of England and Winston Churchill’s closest friend, was known for his incisive wit and precision of expression. In one case, he was making lengthy submissions to a judge who was clearly struggling with the complexities of the dispute.</p> \n<p>The judge interrupted him and said: “Mr. Smith, I have listened to you now for an hour and I am afraid I am none the wiser.” To which Smith responded: “No wiser, my Lord, but much better informed.”</p> \n<p>Keep that response in mind, because it is relevant to this topic.</p> \n<p>There is a move afoot to require companies from the natural resource industries to disclose the amount of money they pay to governments for the right to extract their natural resources. It began in the United States and has now spread to Europe.</p> \n<p>Why? So the people in those countries can see how much money their government is receiving for those public resources. The thinking is they can then hold their governments accountable for what is received. Some even argue it would reduce corruption.</p> \n<p>It all sounds laudable when put in this way. But as with most legal issues, the devil is in the detail. In fact, what is being proposed won’t achieve any of those aims. Let’s take a closer look at each claim.</p> \n<p>First, people will not find out how much their government is receiving. That’s because the only corporations this legislation can apply to are those under U.S. or European jurisdiction. The biggest energy companies in the world, the national oil companies and quasi-nationals from Russia, China, Asia-Pacific, South America and the Middle East, don’t fall under U.S. or European jurisdiction.</p> \n<p>So, the total amount many governments receive will not be revealed by this legislation.</p> \n<p>Will it reduce corruption? No. The legislation only requires a company to disclose how much it paid to the government. It is not corruption to pay a government taxes, royalties and signature bonuses for the rights to extract oil and gas; that’s what governments do – they sell their mineral rights to the highest bidder.</p> \n<p>But this legislation does pose competitive harm to the companies required to comply with it.</p> \n<p>Let’s say you are from a country not subject to this legislation. You and the government official negotiating the contract both know what the competition is likely to bid, because they have had to disclose what they bid for previous, similar contracts. Meanwhile, what you pay will never have to be revealed. And neither you, nor the government official, is caught by the US or European anti-corruption legislation.</p> \n<p>I leave you to draw your own conclusions about the implications.</p> \n<p>In case there should be any doubt, let me be clear: Shell supports financial transparency reporting. Two weeks ago, Shell published the total amounts we paid to governments last year in most of the main countries in which we operate. We did this in advance of any mandate to demonstrate our commitment to disclosure. We believe it is important that companies be open regarding how much they pay to governments.</p> \n<p>We also believe governments should be encouraged to be open about what they receive and how they spend it. <br />People should know what their governments receive for rights to extract natural resources. But they should get the full picture, and the only entity in the position to provide the full picture is the government.</p> \n<p>There are a few governments that do just that. Nigeria and Norway, for example, comply with EITI, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. EITI encourages governments to disclose and verify all amounts they receive from all entities that extract their natural resources. This way, people get the full picture and not a distorted or partial one.</p> \n<p>As F.E. Smith might have said to a smarter judge, they are both better informed and wiser.</p> \n<p>Shell is a founder and board member of EITI and firmly believes its approach is the most effective way to provide revenue transparency. But that does not seem to be direction in which legislators are heading. Instead, governments generally seem to be favoring legislation that would force US and European companies to disclose what they are paying for individual projects – so all the downside and none of the benefit.</p> \n<p>But what happens when that mandate conflicts with what other governments require? Some governments require you to enter into confidentiality agreements barring you from disclosing what you are paying them. Some even make it a criminal offence to do so. So to comply with the legislation in one country to disclose this information, we would have to violate the law of another country.</p> \n<p>What should we do?</p> \n<p>The Dodd-Frank legislation in the United States says it does not matter that to disclose the information would be illegal in another country, you still must disclose. And therein is my dilemma: Do I advise my company to be illegal in the United States or illegal in another country?</p> \n<p>Again, an issue that looked perfectly soluble, but which the legislators are making insoluble.</p> \n<p>Now, let me turn to the one that looks insoluble and continues to be: Piracy.</p><h2>Piracy</h2><p>Back in the 18th century, it was considered perfectly legal for a ship’s crew to hang pirates if there was no legal process available, as in international waters. This was considered a necessity, since captured pirates were considered too dangerous to keep on board during lengthy voyages at sea.</p> \n<p>While the administration of the ultimate penalty seems severe today, it largely eliminated piracy by the late 19th century. Of course, we don’t hang pirates today – and I hasten to add I am not advocating that we resume the practice! But the fact is no one really has a clue what to do with today’s pirates.</p> \n<p>There is no international body empowered to try and imprison them. Nobody wants to hold pirates on a ship until they return to port, because they can only be tried if the vessel subject to the pirate attack was under the flag of your nation. Not surprisingly, trying pirates is not the sort of business flag countries like Panama, Bermuda and the Marshall Islands are eager to embrace.</p> \n<p>Jurisdiction is the issue. Piracy, by definition, happens on the high seas, outside anyone’s jurisdiction. And if you can’t hang them, you can’t imprison them and you can’t take them back to shore, what do you do?</p> \n<p>This is not just a practical problem, but a legal one as well, for my industry and others that must ship products through seas where pirates operate. We and other oil companies have little choice but to ship our products either through the Suez Canal, down the Red Sea and out into the Indian Ocean, or down the west coast of Africa.</p> \n<p>In the past two years, there were about 15 pirate attacks a month on vessels in the Indian Ocean, of which about 20% were successful. Attacks off the coast of West Africa ran averaged about seven a month.</p> \n<p>So what can we do to resolve the problem?</p> \n<p>Initially, vessels used defensive tactics such as higher seaboards, putting razor wire round the ship or employing water cannons. But when some vessels began carrying armed soldiers or guards, a different set of legal questions came into play:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> What legal considerations apply to arming vessels? </li> \n <li> What is the attitude of the nations under whose flags these vessels operate? </li> \n <li> What liabilities will they incur if a death occurs during a pirate attack? </li> \n <li> What is the attitude of the vessels’ insurers? Will they deny insurance claims? </li> \n <li> What will the attitude be of the armed guards’ countries if they are killed or if they kill or injure someone? </li> \n <li> And what if that someone isn’t a pirate, but an innocent bystander, such as a fisherman or a crew member caught in the cross-fire? </li> \n <li> To what extent can consent from the flag country and insurers give you some protection? </li> \n <li> To what extent can drawing up detailed rules of engagement for armed guards provide safeguards if there are subsequent injuries or deaths? </li> \n <li> Where can criminal charges be brought? Which countries will have jurisdiction over civil claims? </li> \n</ul> \n<p>I have just asked nearly a dozen legal questions, to which there are no definitive answers. What advice would you give when the question arises: others are arming their ships, what should we do? How do we fulfill any duty of care we may have to the crews of our vessels?&nbsp; Are we in breach of our duty if we don’t arm? Or do we put our crews in more danger if we do?</p> \n<p>These are no longer hypothetical questions. For example, two Indian fishermen were killed by Italian navy personnel on duty on an Italian flagged oil tanker as the vessel was sailing along the Indian coast. It appears they mistook them for pirates. India arrested the two Italian sailors. Italy accused India of breaching its territorial jurisdiction by arresting them in international waters.</p> \n<p>Last month, Italy announced it had paid $380,000 to the families of two fishermen as a gesture of goodwill, but not as an admission of responsibility for the deaths. In response, the relatives agreed to withdraw their cases against the sailors. But the Indian state has not dropped its criminal charges against the two men and they are awaiting prosecution.</p> \n<p>In February, Danish naval forces opened fire on a suspected pirate ship when it refused to stop. Two hostages being held by the pirates were killed. While it appears the pirates killed the hostages, the question arises: Would they have been killed if the navy had not attacked?</p> \n<p>So, as with financial transparency, I leave you with a dilemma: Do I advise my company to arm our vessels or not arm them? And what do I advise will be the legal consequences if we do or don’t?</p> \n<p>Okay, so far I sound like a guy with a lot of problems and no solutions. So I’ll conclude with an example of a major issue for which, I am proud to say, we have created a solution.</p><h2>Contracting and procurement</h2><p>Shell signs about 1 million contracts a year with more than 120,000 suppliers in practically every country in the world, generating an annual spend of $65 billion.</p> \n<p>In the past, these contracts involved more than 100,000 different sets of contractual Terms &amp; Conditions, or T&amp;Cs, in more than 100 different legal jurisdictions. It was not the most efficient way to contract and purchase. Contracts were taking far longer than they should to negotiate, taking up unnecessary amounts of management and legal time.</p> \n<p>This resulted in very different terms and conditions, and usually different prices, for the supply of fundamentally the same product in different parts of the world. This is a legal problem not just for Shell, but for nearly every multinational company in the world.</p> \n<p>The solution is easy in theory: standardisation. But given the scope of our operations, is standardisation even possible in practice?</p> \n<p>Well, since January 2010, the in-house legal team supporting Shell’s procurement function standardised the legal terms and conditions for all of Shell’s procurement contracts. We now have one standard set of T&amp;Cs used by all of Shell’s businesses and functions.</p> \n<p>How was it done? The core team consulted Shell lawyers, representing more than 100 countries, and the global network of Shell procurement professionals to develop a single starting point for the T&amp;Cs. The goal was to make all the terms of the T&amp;Cs enforceable in all jurisdictions.</p> \n<p>They had to meet local legal and fiscal requirements as well as reflect the different needs of the businesses and functions that would use them. The T&amp;Cs also would be used by our project contractors and joint ventures.</p> \n<p>We adopted a fair starting point for the T&amp;Cs to save time by eliminating the usual negotiating posturing. Our T&amp;Cs are “fair market” and not skewed towards us.</p> \n<p>In the beginning, some feared starting negotiations “from the middle.” They worried it would result in a worse outcome for Shell overall if suppliers still applied the traditional negotiating approach of starting at two ends of the spectrum and landing somewhere in the middle.</p> \n<p>That has not proved the case, fortunately, because of the second change we implemented. Having a “fair” set of T&amp;Cs has meant we can now adopt a different approach to negotiations. We simply attach the T&amp;Cs to the tender invitation, and tell suppliers any mark-up of the T&amp;Cs will be rejected.</p> \n<p>Instead, they are invited to rank a limited number of reservations on the T&amp;Cs as part of their tender response. We can only make this approach work because the T&amp;Cs reflect a fair allocation of risk.</p> \n<p>Shell’s standard model contracts library was rolled out in January 2011. Tracking data show the standard T&amp;Cs are being used by more than 1,000 procurement professionals in Shell each month.</p> \n<p>All sorts of advantages have resulted. Our contracting today is faster and more certain. On average, we’ve cut in half the time it takes to negotiate contracts. And there has been a significant improvement in the prices we are paying.</p> \n<p>The project was devised, managed and implemented exclusively by Shell’s lawyers. Doing it in-house made sense, given the volume and complexity of the commercial legal work we deal with every day. We know of no company that has implemented this scale of change to its legal contracting techniques in procurement, with or without external legal support.</p> \n<p>An effort like this that brings the business enormous value can only help increase the appreciation of what lawyers do within a company. Today, we are no longer viewed as getting in the way of business, as people who say you can’t do this or that, or that you can only do it this way.</p> \n<p>That attitude has disappeared within Shell. It wasn’t always that way, however.</p> \n<p>I’d like to close tonight by reading excerpts from a letter that Shell’s then-CEO Sir Henri Deterding sent in 1916 to the managing director of Shell’s operations in the United States:</p> \n<p><em>Dear Mr. Luyks:</em></p> \n<p><em>I duly received yours of the 22nd regarding Messrs. Rice &amp; Lyons’ remuneration.</em></p> \n<p><em>You gave me rather a start with your letter, because I gather from it that you employ solicitors much oftener than we would ever dream of doing. </em></p> \n<p><em>Although we have an enormous business here, we rarely consult lawyers. We only do so when there is really a legal difference or legal difficulty, whilst it seems to me that you employ them practically in every instance.</em></p> \n<p><em>Lawyers are not business people; however large a lawyer’s experience may be, in the conduct of business he is absolutely useless. A lawyer placed at the head of a concern would soon bring the business to rack and ruin. </em></p> \n<p><em>He is not a creative genius, he is able to give his opinion if a case is laid before him, but to ask a lawyer to draw up a contract for you is a most foolish thing to do, and this is bound to lead to trouble. </em></p> \n<p><em>Our custom here is to draw up a contract before having seen the lawyer and then to ask him to put it in more legal shape. Such a contract is more likely to embody the spirit of what has been agreed upon than one drawn up by a lawyer; to ask his opinion as to what you should do or not do is the worst possible way of conducting business, which should be kept as far as possible from lawyers.</em></p> \n<p><em>It seems to me from your letter as if the lawyers are a kind of department to your business. Their idea that we should be inclined to give them a fixed fee is absurd, but what astonishes me most is their firm proposal that you should make an arrangement, by which one member of their firm should give practically his entire time to the conduct of our affairs. </em></p> \n<p><em>We would never think of such an arrangement. I hate to see a lawyer in our office; if I want him I go to his office and limit the conversation to the shortest possible period. </em></p> \n<p><em>Allowing a lawyer to be practically in daily touch with me would certainly take 90% of my time, which ought to be devoted to money-making and not to discussing legal squabbles or legal phraseologies.</em></p> \n<p><em>Yours sincerely, <br />H. Deterding</em></p> \n<p><br />There are many global legal challenges facing the petro-chemical industry today, some soluble and many which look like they won’t be. But what does seem to be accepted today is that we will need lawyers to help solve them.</p> \n<p>Thank you.</p>",

It’s a pleasure to be here, at one of the most important annual events for the energy industry.<br /><br />Today I’m going to discuss some seismic changes in energy supply and demand, and the challenges that these are creating for the industry.<br /><br />Drawing on both my current role as Shell’s Downstream Director and my experience in the upstream, I’ll then discuss how the industry can address these challenges by raising and diversifying output, and by reshaping the downstream sector.<br /><br />Finally, I’ll discuss how integrated International Oil Companies (IOCs) can leverage their combined upstream and downstream capabilities to help achieve this.</p><h2>Energy demand and supply</h2><p>Since last year’s summit it’s been another turbulent 12 months for the industry, with ongoing tensions in the Middle East and economic uncertainty.</p> \n<p>However, there are tentative signs that the outlook may be improving. Although there are still some serious risks, especially in Europe, it seems global economic activity rebounded somewhat in the first quarter of 2012.<br /><br />And over the longer term, energy demand is resuming its strong upward trajectory. Worldwide energy demand could double in the first half of this century, driven by a rising population and economic growth.<br /><br />With millions of drivers taking to the road, demand for liquid transport fuels will grow particularly strongly, even as vehicle efficiency improves. According to the IEA, global liquid fuels demand could rise by 26% in the next 25 years, to over 110 million barrels a day.<br /><br />Growth will be particularly strong in Asia’s emerging economies. In China, for example, the vehicle fleet could more than triple in the next 20 years to around 600 million vehicles. As a result, China&acute;s oil demand could more than double by 2030, reaching nearly 1.5 times the current US level.<br /><br />Globally, oil supply will struggle to keep pace with demand. This is partly due to declining output from mature fields - perhaps by 80% by 2035.&nbsp; Just to replace this lost output, the world needs new production capacity equivalent to one Saudi Arabia every three years.<br /><br />In many regions, much of the easily accessible oil has been tapped, and supply increasingly comes from challenging and remote locations with high oil prices necessary to incentivise the required investments.<br /><br />According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), output from resources like oil sands and other heavy oils has increased tenfold since 1980, and is set to quadruple again by 2035. The rapid development of liquid-rich shales – using the same hydraulic fracturing technologies as shale gas – holds significant promise, if it can be extended globally.<br /><br />From an upstream perspective, these trends are a testament to rapid innovation unlocking new resources. But in the downstream, shifting demand and increasing reliance on complex oils create challenges around refining and distribution.<br /><br />China, for example, has roughly half the refining capacity of the United States, but its oil demand will exceed that of the US by 2035.<br /><br />To adapt to these changes, the IEA estimates the world needs $10 trillion of new oil infrastructure by 2035, as part of $38 trillion in energy infrastructure worldwide. Across the world’s energy system, that’s around $3 million of investment every single minute for almost 25 years. And for the industry, that adds up to a major challenge.</p><h2>Raising production of liquid fuels</h2><p>So how to respond? <br /><br />I believe the industry needs to do several things: increase liquid fuel supplies, diversify the transport fuel mix, and build greater flexibility into the downstream infrastructure.<br /><br />First, increasing production of liquid fuels.<br /><br />Thanks to rapid innovation, potentially huge new energy resources are coming online.<br /><br />But the industry needs to continue finding more resources: and developing the infrastructure to process and distribute them will be an enormous challenge.<br /><br />Output from Canada’s oil sands, for example, could triple by 2035, to 4.5 million barrels per day. Making that happen requires not only the capacity to extract oil, but also to bring it to market. According to the American Petroleum Institute, oil sands output could be constrained by 2014, due to limited pipeline capacity to US refineries and markets.<br /><br />To unlock the true potential of Canada’s oil sands, the industry and governments must ensure the right pipelines, upgraders and refineries are in place. At Shell, we’ve increased capacity at our Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Alberta by 100,000 barrels per day, opening a second mine and expanding the upgrader converting bitumen into crude.<br /><br />But industry wide, oil sands output risks outgrowing capacity to process and export it. Similarly, the rapid rise of onshore oil production in the US – typified by the Bakken development – are testing the limits of the infrastructure and refining system.</p><h2>Diversifying the transport fuel supply</h2><p>Another way to meet rising demand is by diversifying the transport fuel mix. This includes increasing the contribution of biofuels.</p> \n<p><br />A key benefit of biofuels like sugar-cane ethanol is that they are compatible with existing infrastructure, and can be distributed at ordinary filling stations. The IEA says global demand for biofuels could triple by 2035 as public acceptance grows. <br /><br />At Shell, we recently launched the Ra&iacute;zen joint venture with Cosan in Brazil, which will produce and distribute over 2 billion litres of sugar-cane ethanol each year. Because sugar-cane ethanol emits up to 70% less CO<sub>2</sub> than standard petrol over the lifecycle, it can help make liquid fuels more environmentally acceptable in an era of tighter regulation. <br /><br />Another promising area is natural gas. The development of potentially huge new resources like shale gas continues to revolutionise the supply outlook in many regions. North America, for example, now has a century of gas supplies at current consumption rates, just a few years after it was feared production decline had set in.&nbsp; Many other regions offer similar prospects.<br /><br />So natural gas as a transport fuel will also grow, both through conversion to liquid fuel and directly into transportation.<br /><br />Last year’s opening of Pearl GTL, the huge gas-to-liquids plant developed by Shell and Qatar Petroleum, was a significant landmark for the industry. With a total investment of some $18-$19 billion, it illustrates the scale of infrastructure needed to meet rising demand. Pearl will produce enough GTL gasoil to fill the equivalent of over 160,000 cars a day, as well as products like chemical feedstocks and lubricants, helping generate new revenue from Qatar’s abundant gas resources.<br /><br />LNG also holds great potential as a transport fuel, thanks partly to its ability to reduce CO2 emissions and local air pollution. In Canada, Shell is building LNG refuelling stations along the Alberta to Vancouver trucking route, enabling truck fleets to run on natural gas instead of diesel. As technology improves, LNG could play a growing role in the transport fuel mix.<br /><br />So gas is likely to gain market share in transportation fuel, but refiners and marketers may gain as well: historically low prices for natural gas offer manufacturers a powerful competitive advantage, potentially stimulating economic growth and ensuring more robust oil demand in the future.</p><h2>Reshaping the downstream sector</h2><p>The third way to meet rising fuel demand is by developing a more flexible and efficient downstream sector.<br /><br />Of course, the downstream has not had an easy few years. The economic downturn, higher oil prices, and improving vehicle efficiency have dampened demand in mature markets. As margins have tightened, the industry has seen a spate of refinery closures. In the UK, for example, the number of refineries has fallen from 18 in the late 1970s to 8 today.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that some existing refineries are unsuitable for processing more difficult crudes on which supply increasingly depends. They are in the wrong places. And they make the wrong products.<br /><br />In China, increasing imports of higher-sulphur crudes from the Middle East put pressure on refineries designed to process sweeter domestic crudes. And the big petrol machines in the Atlantic Basin increasingly find demand for petrol stagnant or declining, in the face of petrolcapacity increases in the Middle East and Asia.<br /><br />To address these challenges, the industry needs more efficient, flexible, integrated refineries. That’s a big ask, given today’s tough investment climate. But one example of what we could see more of is Shell and Saudi Aramco’s Motiva joint venture expanding the Port Arthur Refinery on the Gulf of Mexico, from 275,000 to 600,000 barrels per day.<br /><br />The expansion will enable us to process heavy, sour, acid crudes from wherever they become available – initially Saudi Arabia, but also other areas. It will be able to shift easily between producing petrol and diesel as demand changes. And it will have a large diesel export capacity to help meet robust global demand, while also supplying US markets with an efficient inland distribution system.<br /><br />This kind of flexible, integrated infrastructure is central to Shell’s plans for selective downstream expansion.</p><h2>The role of the integrated IOC</h2><p>Of course, doing all this will not be easy.<br /><br />Finding new resources, extracting them from challenging locations, processing and distributing them represents a truly global challenge, spanning the entire value chain.<br /><br />In this context, I believe integrated IOCs have a critical role to play.<br /><br />By combining our upstream and downstream capabilities, integrated companies can drive innovation and match resources with demand on a global basis.</p> \n<p>We will increasingly do this in close collaboration with our NOC partners.<br /><br />This includes building triangular relationships between IOCs like Shell, major resource holders, and major demand holders.<br /><br />Shell’s partnership with CNPC is a great example. Within China, we’re working with CNPC’s listed arm, Petrochina, to develop tight gas resources to help meet growing domestic demand.<br /><br />But we’re also looking beyond China’s borders, even joining together to buy a company in a third country: Arrow Energy, in Australia.<br /><br />In a great example of tripartite co-operation, Shell and Petrochina have also joined with Qatar Petroleum to explore for natural gas onshore and offshore Qatar. And drawing on Shell’s downstream expertise, Petrochina, QP and Shell are now developing plans for an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in the eastern Chinese city of Taizhou. By linking diverse partners, we can match new resources with new demand.<br /><br />Linking upstream and downstream activities also means integrated companies can create commercial opportunities right along the value chain.<br /><br />Our Pearl GTL project with Qatar Petroleum is again a good example. Shell has been perfecting the technology behind Pearl for more than 30 years. We hold about 3,500 patents in the GTL process. To deliver Pearl, we drew on advanced technical skills from right across the company.<br /><br />Our upstream business helps produce 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day from Qatar’s North Field. And our downstream draws on over 30 years of research and development to convert that gas into products like GTL gasoil, kerosene and baseoils. The downstream also helps market and distribute these products around the world.<br /><br />By fusing upstream and downstream operations, we can link resource holders with demand holders, and help NOCs realise their global ambitions.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, recent years have seen seismic changes on both the demand and supply side of the energy industry.<br /><br />A combination of rising demand, a shifting global energy footprint and an increasing reliance on complex resources is creating significant challenges for the industry.<br /><br />But with the right projects and partnerships, IOCs and NOCs can leverage each other’s strengths to bring customers and resources together.</p> \n<p>And on that note, I look forward to the discussion.</p>",

I’m glad to be back at China University of Petroleum.</p> \n<p>It's been about a year since I accepted my honorary professorship here. A lot has happened in that time.</p> \n<p>My main purpose today is to update you on some important developments that have taken place in the world of natural gas; and to give you some deeper insights into a revolutionary new technology that I touched on last time: Floating LNG.</p><h2>Shell in China</h2><p>Before I do that, let me remind you briefly about why Shell is in China.</p> \n<p>We are here to provide energy solutions, and to contribute to the country's three key energy priorities: security of energy supply, environmental protection, and energy efficiency.</p> \n<p>In terms of market position relative to other international energy companies, we are the leading lubricants manufacturer and marketer, and number one bitumen supplier, with 12 bitumen production bases in China supplying high quality products to customers all over the country.</p> \n<p>We are also the number one supplier of coal gasification technologies. Shell has so far provided proprietary coal gasification technology in China through 19 licenses. The technology helps China use coal in a cleaner manner. <br />All of Shell's businesses are active in China: Upstream, Downstream, and Projects &amp; Technology.</p> \n<p>Innovation is central to all of these businesses. And many of the areas where we innovate are represented in China: for instance, petrochemicals and differentiated oil products; also liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as well as tight gas, shale gas and coalbed methane – I’ll be talking more about these a little later.</p> \n<p>Shell’s four strategic priorities for growth in China remain the same. We’re focused on international cooperation with our Chinese partners overseas, to bring energy back to China. Secondly, we’re dedicated to developing China's gas resources and providing quality, cleaner products to help meet the country's energy needs. Our third priority is to take Chinese enterprises overseas. And finally, we are concentrating on R&amp;D and technology cooperation, with prestigious institutions like this one.</p> \n<p>Shell has a proud tradition of collaborating with leading universities and research institutes across the globe. Here in China, we are working with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a number of top universities in a wide range of open-innovation and joint R&amp;D activities. Some of those activities span the oil and gas industry – from upstream to downstream. And some of them look beyond oil and gas – and far into the future.</p> \n<p>Among these collaborative activities, I am particularly pleased to see our increased R&amp;D cooperation with China University of Petroleum. We are jointly developing new chemical technology for enhanced oil recovery and novel catalysts for refining. And just today we signed a new agreement for a joint R&amp;D programme covering unconventional gas exploration and development, to help meet China’s future energy demand.</p><h2>Shell history in gas</h2><p>I said I was going to talk with you today about natural gas. That’s an area that has seen amazing innovation!</p> \n<p>When I started in exploration, some 30 years ago, people viewed finding gas as poor performance. All the attention was on oil. We had lots of technology to help us differentiate oil from gas pre-drilling, to ensure that valuable exploration funds were not wasted on gas. How times have changed!</p> \n<p>We have moved from our industry flaring off natural gas as a waste by-product, to gas becoming a core part of the energy mix. In 2011, 48% of Shell’s production was natural gas. This year, 2012, we expect to produce more gas than oil.</p> \n<p>Natural gas is not just abundant. It is also a hotbed of innovation. Just think about GTL and LNG, for instance.</p> \n<p>LNG is what you get when you cool natural gas to -162 degrees Celsius. Shell’s track record in LNG goes back over 45 years. We helped to design and build the world's first commercial onshore LNG plant in 1964.</p> \n<p>Today, we are widely recognised across the industry as a technology and market leader. We’re involved in every stage of the value chain, from upstream – i.e. finding and extracting the gas – through processing, to distribution and sales. Shell is one of the largest LNG vessel operators in the world: around one-quarter of all the world’s LNG carriers are linked to Shell and our joint venture partners.</p><h2>Gas today</h2><p>Why do we concentrate so much on natural gas? Because of its ‘Triple A’ status as fuel. It is accessible, affordable, and has the most acceptable environmental footprint of all the fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>Some people have described natural gas as a ‘transition’ fuel, part of the ‘bridge’ to a renewables-only future. However, the reality is quite different. All the energy forms we can deploy will be needed to meet global needs over the next few decades: not just wind, solar, biomass, hydro and the like, but also fossil fuels. Gas, especially, will be centre stage – it is not a transition fuel but a ‘destination’ fuel.</p> \n<p>Over the last few years, this position has been reinforced by extraordinary volumes of gas found in the form of tight and shale gas, and coalbed methane or CBM. It is estimated that the world has enough recoverable gas resources for about 250 years at current production levels; and tight and shale gas and CBM account for about half those resources.</p> \n<p>The US Energy Information Administration said last year that China’s shale formations may hold 12 times its conventional gas deposits. Last month, the nation’s Ministry of Land and Resources announced preliminary surveys showing explorable shale gas reserves of 25.1 trillion cubic metres, enough – in theory – to meet China’s gas needs for the next two centuries.</p> \n<p>China has been very dynamic in grasping this opportunity.</p> \n<p>Together CNPC and Shell operate the Changbei tight gas field in the Ordos basin, where commercial production started in March 2007. In 2010 our two companies signed a 30 year agreement to develop tight gas in Jinqiu.</p> \n<p>CNPC started shale gas exploration and development in 2006; it was the first Chinese company to do so. Last month Shell and CNPC signed a contract for shale gas exploration, development and production on the Fushun-Yongchuan block in Sichuan basin.</p> \n<p>I would also highlight the joint purchase of Australian coalbed methane company Arrow Energy, by PetroChina and Shell, in 2010. Our two companies are jointly developing the North Shilou CBM block; the project is currently in the appraisal phase.</p> \n<p>You can see there is a lot going on. And Shell is able to bring to these ventures the benefits of our extensive experience in North America – not just in terms of finding and extracting tight and shale gas resources, but also in terms of the performance breakthroughs that we have achieved, and the reduction we have been able to make in our operations’ environmental footprint, through automation and other means.</p> \n<p>Moreover, in China, we have been able to speed up the learning curve to reduce drilling time, compared with how quickly we achieved this in the US. It’s a winning combination: the great people we're working with in China, and the power of bringing together their local knowledge with our international expertise.</p> \n<p>In another joint venture with CNPC, we’re creating something very exciting for the future of tight and shale gas development.</p> \n<p>I should explain that economically developing such fields requires hundreds, and even thousands, of wells. Normally, wells are drilled using rigs that are very large, complex, and multi-functional; and a trained crew drills each well individually.</p> \n<p>CNPC and Shell have come up with quite a different model. In our concept, a group of smaller rigs, mounted on trucks, are employed. Each of these rigs performs a step, or a series of steps, in the drilling process, and then moves on to the next well. So, for example, one rig would drill the top part of the hole; another would drill the intermediate part of the well; and a third would do the completion work.</p> \n<p>The rigs would be controlled autonomously, rather than operated manually. Several wells, at different stages of drilling and completion, would be being drilled in a given field at any one time.</p> \n<p>We call this approach ‘well manufacturing’, because of the way it resembles a production line in a factory. It delivers what tight and shale gas, and CBM, require: a great many wells drilled quickly, safely, at reasonable cost, and with a smaller environmental footprint.</p> \n<p>The well manufacturing concept is based on standardised well designs and automated field development. Shell has developed computer algorithms to optimise the drilling procedures and allow them to be automated. These have already been tested successfully in a heavy oil field in Canada, and are used commercially in gas wells in the Netherlands and the USA.</p> \n<p>But it’s not just about automating the rigs. CNPC and Shell are looking at automating other functions as well: for instance, developing a system that could monitor drilling fluids real time and decide when to treat them.</p><h2>Next game-changer: Floating LNG</h2><p>All these efforts will underpin China’s future ability to meet energy demand. In the meantime, the pace of economic growth here has led China to become a net importer of energy. Domestic consumption of natural gas has exceeded production since 2009. Today, Shell is the largest LNG supplier to China in terms of contract volume.</p> \n<p>And that helps to explain why the development of Floating LNG is so relevant here. This is a game-changing technology breakthrough. We believe it will revolutionise the natural gas sector.</p> \n<p>In it, you can see the coming together of Shell's technology leadership drawing on more than five decades of expertise in LNG technology, LNG shipping and operating offshore oil and gas installations.</p> \n<p>For example, the first ever Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel, or FPSO, went into operation in 1977 for Shell, in Spain. Since then we have accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise with these floating solutions, which are essential to our industry’s offshore business activities.</p> \n<p>We are now combining decades of revolutionary and incremental development in engineering and technology to create Floating LNG. Proven technologies are being brought together in innovative combinations, to realise an integrated concept, which is replicable elsewhere.</p> \n<p>FLNG will allow Shell to produce, liquefy, store and transfer LNG at sea, opening up new business opportunities for countries looking to develop their gas resources and bring more natural gas to market.</p> \n<p>Let me describe the vessel to you. Its length is nearly equal to five football pitches, and will have the displacement of six aircraft carriers. It needs to be this large to make the economics of its operation work, and also to help it withstand the often extreme weather conditions that it’s likely to experience.</p> \n<p>The design is very clever. So, although the vessel is very large by maritime standards, it is still only one-quarter the size of an equivalent facility on land.</p> \n<p>Top of our priority list, as ever, is safety – at every stage of the project.</p> \n<p>The choices made during the design phase were based on over 10 years of studies of what would be required to maximise safety. So, for instance, the facility is designed to withstand a Category 5 cyclone. Extensive testing and simulation have been carried out, to ensure the vessel will stay moored in any weather conditions.</p> \n<p>The storage facilities and process equipment are located as far from crew accommodation as possible. And procedures and systems are in place for operating in severe weather: they cover things like discontinued offloading, stopping production, and evacuating personnel.</p> \n<p>I am also very pleased to note that the Shell Life-Saving Rules, which are mandatory in all our own operations, have also been adopted throughout the construction yard.</p> \n<p>Another challenge that FLNG presents is sloshing. There is the potential for sizeable waves to develop within the LNG tanks when they are partly filled. These waves could be initiated under certain wave and weather conditions when using unfavorable tank dimensions.</p> \n<p>To deal with this challenge, the tank dimensions are chosen so that sloshing is not likely in expected weather conditions. In addition, the tank walls are reinforced and – in extreme conditions - it is possible to optimise the inventory so that tanks are either almost full or almost empty, both helping to prevent damage. You have to bear in mind that the vessel is not planned to have drydock respite for 25 years.</p> \n<p>Our FLNG design can provide high production rates: up to 6 million tonnes a year of liquids including LNG, LPG and condensate. Note, too, that it is multipurpose: the vessel can export Liquefied Petroleum Gas as well as LNG at the sides of the vessel; and condensate at the rear.</p> \n<p>I’d like to shine a light on some of the clever ideas we’ve included. For instance, the vessel takes advantage of the fact that it is sitting in cold oceans and it takes cooling water from a depth of about 150 metres which helps to improve the energy efficiency of the liquefaction process.</p> \n<p>We’ve chosen steam to drive the power generation, the compressors, and to provide reboiler heat.</p> \n<p>I should also highlight an important process involved in the liquefaction: Shell’s proprietary Dual Mixed Refrigerant process, or DMR. This has two mixed refrigerant cycles and makes the process very flexible. It is also better able to cope with changes in feed gas composition. DMR has proved to be very stable and efficient in the Sakhalin II project in Russia. It will add considerably to the FLNG solution.</p> \n<p>FLNG is ideally suited to fields with reserves of 2-3 tcf and more, with high production rates and a range of gas compositions. Compared with other options, it has many advantages. FLNG is not only good for situations where you have stranded gas remote from shore. It has great potential close to shore, where you need to tie together several small fields. We also believe that FLNG will enable the development of larger fields via multiple facilities.</p> \n<p>I said it looks like revolutionising the natural gas sector. That’s because of the unprecedented combination of benefits it offers: cost savings, less environmental impact, and increased opportunities to monetise natural gas resources in more challenging reservoirs and locations.</p> \n<p>I am very excited about FLNG because it is good for operators, partners, customers and governments. It has the potential for faster, cheaper, more flexible development and deployment strategies for resources that were previously uneconomic.</p> \n<p>I also like the way the vessel is part of an integrated approach. A successful FLNG project is much more than the facility itself. It includes upstream infrastructure and operations; product carrier management; LNG marketing; plus logistical and land-based support.</p> \n<p>The technologies combined in FLNG are very impressive. But it’s not just about technical credibility. To succeed, an FLNG project demands: a proven capability to successfully deliver megaprojects; a balance sheet capable of supporting the finance and insurance requirements; the capacity to underwrite long term off-take and bring gas to markets; strong partnerships; and healthy project economics.</p><h2>First application: Prelude project, Australia</h2><p>I am glad to say, these are in place. And Shell is the first company in the world to get an FLNG project under construction.</p> \n<p>This project, known as Prelude FLNG, has some impressive statistics. It is located more than 200 kilometres off the North West coast of Australia. 600 engineers worked on the design options. 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools would be needed to hold the same amount of liquid as the vessel's storage tanks.</p> \n<p>The facility is designed to stay safe and stable even in most extreme weather conditions. It achieves this due partly to its size, and partly due to being moored using one of the largest systems in the world: a turret 105 metres high, with 4 groups of mooring lines anchoring it to sea bed. This arrangement means the facility can turn slowly in the wind while staying moored over the gas field. And that means it will save valuable production days that would otherwise be lost to bad weather.</p> \n<p>There will be three thrusters to enable some correction on the natural orientation of the FLNG facility in the prevailing met ocean conditions, which may assist with the mooring of LNG carriers alongside. Each thruster will have 6,700 horsepower – more than 10 times the power of a top-end performance car. In the vessel alone, 260,000 tonnes of steel are required. This is about 5 times the amount of steel in the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</p> \n<p>The Prelude vessel’s LNG production could meet one and a bit times Hong Kong's annual natural gas demand (117%).</p> \n<p>Right now, preparations are being made for the vessel’s construction to begin in South Korea. Meanwhile, in Australia, we are working with local training companies, who have begun the process of training for operators of the facility. I don’t think it is an exaggeration to say that FLNG is opening the way to a new era in gas, with benefits for everyone: resource holders, customers, and other stakeholders. It is doing this using proven technologies, in innovative combinations, based on an integrated concept, which is replicable elsewhere.</p> \n<p>FLNG demonstrates how innovation is giving Shell and our partners a competitive advantage.</p><h2>Training tomorrow’s scientists and engineers</h2><p>It is also not the only such megaproject. Shell has introduced novel technology in large projects involving deep-water oil fields and enhanced oil recovery – both of which could also be relevant in China’s energy scene. If I had the time, I would love to describe them to you. For now, let me just emphasise the common features across all of them: they are mutually beneficial partnerships, with open innovation, and sharing of R&amp;D strengths.</p> \n<p>For that reason, I am particularly proud of our partnerships with Chinese universities and academic institutions. To develop and apply new technologies and help supply the world with sustainable energy, we will continue to need scientists and engineers. And Shell is helping to widen the talent pipeline in China through education.</p> \n<p>I’m very pleased that Shell has set up a PhD scholarship programme in petroleum geosciences with the China University of Petroleum. We see this university as an eminent training ground for professional scientists, technologists and engineers – and also a fertile breeding ground for innovation. I am pleased to note that it is one of Shell China’s key campuses for graduate recruiting.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Currently, Shell is involved in many joint ventures in China. With our Chinese partners, we’re working on shale gas, coalbed methane, petrochemicals and other things.</p> \n<p>But wouldn’t you all agree that there is plenty potential here in China – and elsewhere throughout the world – for even more partnerships, more innovation, more mutual benefit?</p> \n<p>And that’s the question I would like to leave you with. I hope it will prompt some interesting thoughts and discussions.</p>",

It is a great pleasure to be back in China. And it is an honour to have an opportunity to speak with a group of leaders like yourselves.</p> \n<p>I am always inspired by the energy and optimism here in China. <br />&nbsp;<br />During a trip here last June I had the privilege of visiting the famous Daqing oil field, along with members of Shell’s Board of Directors. I was impressed by the incredible determination of Wang Jinxi and the number 1205 drilling team in unlocking that important resource.</p> \n<p>It was a potent reminder of the strength of the human spirit in the face of difficult challenges. That reminder is useful as we look into the future and contemplate the hurdles that lie ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />China is looking for secure and cleaner sources of energy to fuel continued growth and social development in the coming years and decades.</p> \n<p>Indeed, China is at an important crossroad in its development. I think you have an historic opportunity to chart a different path from the energy-intensive one western countries have followed for the past century. One that leads to a new, more sustainable energy system that will underpin your country’s continued growth.</p> \n<p>For the next few minutes I would like to cover three main themes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> The global trends shaping the future of energy. </li> \n <li> The implications those trends have for China.&nbsp; </li> \n <li> And possible ways for China to respond. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>And, of course, I look forward to a lively discussion and to hearing your views.&nbsp;</p><h2>Global energy trends</h2><p>As you know, global energy trends are being driven by the world’s rising population and rapid improvements in prosperity in developing countries. China is, of course, a significant contributor to these trends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last year we welcomed the 7 billionth person to the human race. At the rate we’re going, by mid-century about 9 billion of us will share the planet.</p> \n<p>At the same time, millions of people are climbing out of poverty. They are enjoying higher living standards and buying their first refrigerators and cars.</p> \n<p>This is a great achievement. It also has potentially serious implications for all of us. The world’s growing middle class is raising demand for some of the world’s basic resources, from energy to fresh water and food.</p> \n<p>One of humanity’s biggest challenges today is finding a sustainable means of providing for the basic needs of the world’s growing, wealthier population.</p> \n<p>Let’s look at energy. If the world continues on its current path of consumption, by 2030 global energy demand could grow by 33%. For perspective, that is the equivalent of creating an energy system twice the size of the USA’s in less than two decades.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Almost all of that growth will come from the world’s developing countries, with China accounting for a significant part of the increase.</p> \n<p>One of the most important drivers of growth in energy demand in China will be transportation. As you know, a massive motorization of the population is already under way. In 2009, China overtook the USA to become the world’s largest car market. Over the next 20 years, China’s vehicle fleet is expected to increase from 190 million to 600 million.</p> \n<p>Even assuming continued fuel efficiency improvements and increased use of alternative fuels, such as electricity, the growing thirst for gasoline and diesel means China’s oil demand could more than double to 24 million barrels of oil a day by 2030. That’s nearly one and a half times the current consumption of the USA.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Most of that demand will be met through imports, meaning China will be an increasingly important player in global oil markets.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Stepping back to look at the overall energy picture, if the current trend for growth in consumption continues, China’s primary energy consumption could double by 2030. At that point, China would account for about one-fourth of global energy needs, up from 20% today. And Chinese demand would be nearly twice as high as in the USA, the world’s next-largest energy consumer in 2030.</p> \n<p>Increased energy use will also have environmental implications. Even with rapid growth of renewable energy sources, fossil fuels like coal and oil will continue to supply most of the world’s energy. So society will continue to confront issues of local pollution, as well as rising levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming.</p> \n<p>We must also remember the powerful linkages between energy and other vital resources, such as water. Energy production is a large industrial user of water, so more energy will mean increased water use. <br />The linkages go both ways, of course, since energy is needed to supply, purify and distribute water for a growing number of homes and businesses.</p> \n<p>With two-thirds of China’s cities already short of water, this will also be part of the resource challenge for the future.</p><h2>Supply challenges</h2><p>Now let’s look at the supply outlook. Energy supplies will struggle to keep up with the rapid growth in global demand. That will be particularly true for oil critical for transportation.</p> \n<p>We believe global oil production will plateau at roughly 105 million barrels a day around 2030, up from the current 84 million barrels a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Shell scenarios team projects that global demand for oil could begin to bump against supply limitations starting sometime around 2020, assuming current trends continue. This will create what we call a zone of uncertainty.</p> \n<p>The uncertainty revolves around exactly how to bring supply and demand into balance. The world will need a combination of extraordinary efforts to increase energy supplies and extraordinary measures to limit the growth in demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />At the same time, the pressures of rising demand and potential supply constraints are likely to impact prices.</p> \n<p>Of course, no one can accurately predict the price of oil or any other form of energy in 20 years time. But unless there is a major economic disruption, generally I think we are likely to see a long-term upward trend in energy prices, as well as continued volatility. That will be especially true for oil.<br />&nbsp;<br />These trends could pose a particular challenge for China. Unlike many Western countries, whose development was aided for much of the last century by reliable supplies of cheap energy, China may need to chart a development path during a period of higher and rising energy prices.&nbsp; Likewise, China must manage growing energy use during a period of rising concern about global warming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As you know, China’s population will peak at about 1.4 billion somewhere around 2026.</p> \n<p>By then China will be the world’s biggest economy. But many citizens will likely still live in relative poverty. A major ongoing challenge will be supporting continued economic growth to improve the standard of living for large parts of the population.</p> \n<p>For China, wise policy decisions in the next few years will be critical to ensuring sufficient energy to support China’s continued development in the coming decades. And to ensuring an appropriate response to the serious threat of global warming.</p> \n<p>This may sound daunting. But I’m an optimist and I think China is in an enviable position. You are still in the process of creating your own future. And there is much you can do to shape your destiny.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is an historic opportunity for China to lead the world toward a sustainable energy system. It is a chance for China to avoid some of the development choices made in Western countries that allowed high energy use to become solidly anchored in infrastructure and ways of life.</p><h2>Charting a way forward</h2><p>Given the converging forces of rapidly rising demand and increasing difficulty in unlocking new energy supplies, what can China do to chart a sustainable growth path?</p> \n<p>I think a three-part strategy is likely to help boost China’s energy security and support the continued path of strong growth and social development. They are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> Expand and diversify China’s energy supply. </li> \n <li> Moderate the growth in demand by increasing the already significant efforts to promote energy efficiency. </li> \n <li> Promote new technology that helps accomplish the first two. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let me address them one at a time. China, like the rest of the world, must continue to develop all available energy sources to keep up with demand.</p> \n<p>No single solution will be sufficient. Strong investment will be needed in everything from oil and gas, to wind, solar, biofuels and nuclear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Clearly there will be a growing place for renewable energy, an area where China already has a leadership role. China has quickly become the world’s largest manufacturer of solar cells and wind power equipment. And the 12th five-year plan has set an ambitious goal of 15% of total energy coming from non-fossil sources by 2020.&nbsp; But there is still room to expand use of renewable energy even further, particularly solar.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Perhaps the greatest opportunity lies in increased development of natural gas resources. Natural gas has the potential to spark an energy revolution similar to the one already under way in North America.<br />&nbsp;<br />Over the last decade or so, Shell and other energy companies have developed technology to unlock gas from dense rock such as shale. We use horizontal drilling and a technique called hydraulic fracturing, which pumps water under high pressure into the rock, creating cracks that allow gas to flow more freely to the well.</p> \n<p>This technique has been pioneered in the USA, which just a few years ago feared gas production was destined for steady decline. Indeed, companies rushed to build terminals to receive imported liquefied natural gas.</p> \n<p>Today those terminals stand mostly idle. Thanks to new technology, natural gas production reversed its decline in 2005 and surged nearly 20% by 2010.</p> \n<p>The USA may now have 100 years of natural gas supplies at current consumption rates and will likely become an LNG exporter.&nbsp; The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas production will grow substantially over the next two decades and that by 2035, nearly half of all natural gas produced in North America will come from shale gas, up from just 16% in 2009.</p> \n<p>The dramatic increase in supplies has led to much lower prices. Natural gas in North America now costs less than $2.50 per million Btu. That compares with a 10-year average of about $6 per million Btu.<br />&nbsp;<br />Access to abundant supplies of affordable gas has given a powerful competitive advantage to North American industry. Chemical companies are looking to add capacity to take advantage of gas as an affordable feedstock. <br />The surge in gas supplies, coupled with increased production of oil in the western hemisphere, is making the USA less dependent on countries in the Middle East and West Africa for its energy supplies.</p> \n<p>By 2035, the USA will import about 17% of its energy, down from 29% in 2007, with most of those imports coming from neighbouring countries.</p> \n<p>Natural gas can also have clear environmental benefits. Using it to generate electricity typically generates 40% to 60% less CO₂ than coal-fired power plants. It greatly reduces local emissions of sulphur-dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants. Gas-fired generators are a natural ally of renewable energy, since they can quickly ramp up when the wind dies or the sun doesn’t shine.</p> \n<p>Finally, generating electricity with gas is less water-intensive than either coal or nuclear.</p> \n<p>What does all this mean for China?</p> \n<p>China is still in the early days of developing its own tight gas resources, but the potential looks promising.</p> \n<p>A recent study of tight gas resources in 32 countries by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that China has recoverable tight gas resources of more than 1,000 trillion cubic feet. That is more than the USA and ten times China’s current proved natural gas reserves.</p> \n<p>What about the role of nuclear power as a source of low-carbon energy in the wake of last year’s tragic events in Fukushima, Japan? Countries have responded differently, with some turning away from nuclear power, such as Germany, and others continuing to embrace it, such as France and India.</p> \n<p>Overall, I think some development will continue. The USA, for instance, just granted regulatory approval for two new reactors. However, I expect safety reviews are likely to delay development of new capacity. And tighter safety regulations will likely bring higher costs.</p> \n<p>If China decides to continue its strong drive to develop nuclear energy, the sector will see tremendous growth. By 2030 China will have at least double the nuclear capacity of the USA.</p> \n<p>Even so, because of the size of China’s energy system, nuclear will remain a relatively small contributor to overall energy needs. By 2030 about 10% of electricity might come from nuclear power. By comparison, the USA currently produces slightly less than 20% of its electricity from nuclear.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Coal will continue to play the most important role in China’s energy system, contributing about 50% of overall energy in 2030, compared to about 70% today. But the environmental costs of its use are high and will need to be addressed. It is the country’s leading source of urban air pollution and contributes at least 70% of China’s CO₂ emissions.</p> \n<p>To reduce environmental impact of continued coal use, China will need to install equipment to clean smokestack emissions, increase use of clean coal technology and develop capability to capture CO₂ emissions and store them safely underground.</p> \n<p>Without carbon capture and storage technology, or some other form of emission reduction, by 2030 China could emit about 12 gigatons of CO₂ per year, or about 30% of global emissions from energy use. <br />Coal is also water-intensive. China’s coal industry is responsible for more than 10% of all water consumption, if you include mining, coal preparation, power generation and chemicals production.</p><h2>Managing energy demand</h2><p>Developing all available sources of energy will help ensure a secure supply to continue China’s rapid development. But it won’t be enough.</p> \n<p>China will need to redouble efforts to moderate growth in demand for energy.</p> \n<p>Much progress has already been made, but the good news is that there is still room for improvement. <br />&nbsp;<br />If China were able to make an extra effort and achieve leading levels of efficiency in all industrial sectors, the country’s overall energy demand could be reduced by 10% by 2030.</p> \n<p>I’m not saying it will be easy. Making such dramatic improvements would take huge effort and significant investment. But the payoff in energy security might be worth it.</p> \n<p>Energy efficiency can be gained in countless ways, big and small. But focusing on a few specific areas will likely produce the greatest benefit.</p> \n<p>The rapid rise in individual car ownership and increasing use of trucks to haul freight make road transport an important area for focus.</p> \n<p>Greater emphasis on developing urban mass transit can help keep personal vehicles off the road. For instance, bus rapid transit corridors are a cost-effective and flexible option that can handle up to 50,000 passengers an hour – nearly as many as subways.</p> \n<p>Increased use of alternative fuels for transport will also help boost efficiency and reduce demand for gasoline and diesel. Indeed, China has already made electric and hybrid-electric vehicle development a priority. Over time, China’s large domestic market could help Chinese car manufacturers build world leadership in key automotive technology for the future.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another area of focus is smarter urban development. You know better than I do how rapidly China is shifting from a rural to urban society. As millions of people move into cities every year, urban floor space, including residential and commercial, is doubling every seven years, with more than a billion square metres added every year.</p> \n<p>The traditional “big flat pie” model of Chinese urban development has resulted in relatively high energy consumption. A study of more than 700 Chinese cities by consultant Booz &amp; Co. showed that cities with higher population density were more energy efficient. Similarly, sprawling cities in the USA are more energy hungry than compact European ones.</p> \n<p>As China’s cities grow at a rapid pace, careful planning and controlled urbanization can have a significant impact on future energy use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;So can improvements in construction standards. One estimate suggests that today less than 5% of new buildings in China can be characterized as energy efficient.</p> \n<p>A final area of focus is subsidies supporting consumption of fossil fuels. In a global survey, the International Energy Agency identified 37 countries with estimated subsidies totalling $409 billion in 2010. China’s estimated subsidies totalling $21 billion were the fifth highest globally, after Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and India.</p> \n<p>By masking the true cost of energy, subsidies encourage consumers to use more. The IEA estimates that if subsidies were phased out world-wide, global energy demand would fall 4% by 2020 and nearly 5% by 2035.</p> \n<p>This is obviously a sensitive topic. Subsidies are often meant to ensure the poorest members of society have access to energy – an important goal.</p> \n<p>Yet the IEA estimates that only 8% of the $409 billion in support in 2010 reached the poorest households. The agency argues that providing similar levels of financial support directly to low-income families would be far more efficient.</p><h2>The role of technology</h2><p>Let me now focus briefly on the important role innovation and technology will play in addressing China’s energy challenges.</p> \n<p>New ideas and new technologies will be needed to support many of the objectives I’ve been talking about. From improving energy efficiency and diversifying energy supply, to reducing CO₂ emissions and enabling cost-effective, large-scale use of renewable energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Innovation has driven the natural gas revolution that began in North America and is now expanding around the globe. It will be needed for future advances, such as improving battery performance so electric vehicles are more widely acceptable to consumers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>China will increase the likelihood of major breakthroughs by focusing attention on a limited number of areas that boost energy supplies, or reduce demand.</p> \n<p>On the supply side they could include advanced biofuels and technologies to convert coal to gas or liquid fuels.</p> \n<p>On the demand side they could include efficient co-generation technology and smart electricity grids.</p> \n<p>China should also consider increased spending on research and development. In 2008, R&amp;D spending at large and medium-sized Chinese companies averaged less than 1% of revenues. That compares with about 5% at similar companies in developed countries.</p> \n<p>To concentrate human and financial resources on the most important areas, China could establish a National Energy Technology Laboratory. This would enable resource-sharing among national R&amp;D institutions, universities, industrial enterprises and multinational corporations.</p><h2>Shell’s role</h2><p>Before I conclude, let me briefly tell you what my company is doing to help address China’s energy challenges. Much of it hinges on our deep and growing partnership with CNPC.</p> \n<p>We have four priorities in China.</p> \n<p>First, we are helping support growth through international cooperation with Chinese partners to bring energy supplies back to China. For instance, together with CNPC we acquired Arrow Energy in Australia to develop coal bed methane and turn it into liquefied natural gas for shipment to customers. We are also jointly exploring for gas in Qatar. And CNPC has taken a 20% interest in our Groundbirch tight gas project in Canada, where we are looking at the potential for producing liquefied natural gas for export.</p> \n<p>Here in China, we are developing tight gas resources with CNPC, helping to expand supplies of this cleaner-burning fuel. Together we are pursuing the Changbei project, exploring for gas in Sichuan Province and working on a coal bed methane project in Shanxi Province. And we’re looking for other opportunities.</p> \n<p>We’re also cooperating on R&amp;D and technology. That includes development of advanced seismic technology and a recently incorporated joint venture to develop an innovative, highly automated well manufacturing system to boost gas production.</p> \n<p>Finally, we’re helping Chinese oil and gas service companies gain access to business worldwide. <br />So I think our priorities help support China’s overall energy priorities.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To summarize, fuelling China’s continued rapid growth and social development presents significant challenges. They include ensuring a secure supply of energy, addressing environmental stresses from energy production and use, and dealing with the related stresses on other vital resources such as water.</p> \n<p>But China’s tremendous dynamism and the enduring spirit of “Iron Man” Wang Jinxi make me optimistic that these challenges will be overcome.</p> \n<p>The critical elements for building a secure and sustainable energy system for the future will include expanding all available sources of energy, with special emphasis on natural gas; and aggressively promoting energy efficiency to moderate growth in demand.</p> \n<p>The right mix of policies and incentives can help make that happen.</p> \n<p><em>Thank you. <br /></em></p>",

          "maintext": "<p><em>The world faces a resource consumption puzzle. Supplies of water, energy and food are coming under pressure from an expanding global population. But tackling this problem is made all the more difficult by the powerful connections between these different resources: rising energy consumption puts added strain on the world’s water stocks and vice versa. In these remarks to the 6th World Water Forum in Marseille, Peter Voser describes how Shell’s recent work to quantify water use in the energy industry can support the development of a more co-ordinated approach to energy and water policy – a longstanding aspiration of many in government and industry that has hitherto been frustrated, in part, by a lack of data.</em></p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>Water, energy and the resource consumption puzzle: it’s time for solutions</h2><p>I should begin by thanking the World Water Forum for its invitation to speak today. It’s a great honour for me to appear alongside such distinguished panellists. And it’s heartening to see such recognition of the need for a truly co-ordinated approach to easing the pressure on the world’s water, energy and food resources.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After all, demand for all three will rise in concert thanks to a surging global population, and growth in the developing economies. And there are powerful linkages between these resources. For my own industry, water is an especially important issue. Energy providers are among the largest industrial consumers of freshwater -- even if our consumption pales in comparison to the agricultural sector.</p> \n<p>We need water for drilling, flooding wells, refining crude and producing biofuels. And we need it for power generation and transportation. At the same time, energy is required for the supply, purification, distribution and treatment of water and wastewater. In some Gulf countries the energy needed to desalinate water accounts for around two-thirds of domestic oil use.</p> \n<p>Now, it’s all very well recognizing that these connections exist. But the toughest challenge still remains: what to do about it. For years, policymakers have spoken of the need for a more integrated approach to tackling the world’s environmental challenges. But delivering concrete progress has proved notoriously difficult. And the overwhelming tendency is still to consider each issue in isolation.</p><h2>Shell’s work on water</h2><p>One obstacle has been a lack of hard data - especially about freshwater use. That’s hardly surprising when you consider there’s not even a standard method for accounting for water use in industrial settings. As a consequence, little work has been done to examine the water intensity of different energy pathways or of the energy system as whole.&nbsp; And we’ve lacked a proper overview of where the energy system is putting the world’s water resources under the most strain.</p> \n<p>At Shell, over the past year, we’ve been working with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the University of Utrecht to put this right. In simple terms, we’ve developed a methodology for measuring water use in the industrial sector as a whole. And we’ve applied it to the energy industry.</p> \n<p>Now, I’m at risk of making it all sound too easy. But it means we can now estimate with greater accuracy the amount of water needed to generate energy from different sources – including oil, gas, coal, nuclear and biofuels – using different technologies and in different locations. We have published our findings in a peer reviewed article in a scientific journal.&nbsp; We are also sharing our data with the wider business sector and the International Energy Agency.</p> \n<p>All this should bring several benefits, not least for policymakers deciding how to meet rising demand for heating, transport and electricity. They will have a clearer sense of how different energy pathways might affect their precious water resources. And industrial companies will be able to make more considered strategic and operational decisions in a world of growing water scarcity.</p> \n<p>But this is just the beginning. At Shell, we’re now taking our work a stage further. Some of you will know that for decades we have produced energy scenarios to map how the global energy system might evolve. And that we factor CO<sub>2</sub> emissions into our work. That enables us to see how much CO<sub>2</sub> the world would emit in different energy scenarios - and policymakers to see what needs to be done to meet emissions targets.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thanks to our water accounting project, we will soon be able to do the same for water. We’re factoring our new data on water use into our scenarios models. That will give us a better understanding of the demands the energy system will place on global water resources in the decades ahead. As such, it will be another critical step towards a more integrated approach to energy and environmental policymaking.</p><h2>Initial findings</h2><p>So what are some of the main themes emerging from our work?</p> \n<p>The first is that freshwater consumption in the energy system will grow sharply. That’s partly because global energy demand will double in the first half of this century. It’s also because the world will draw more of its energy from water intensive sources and technologies, such as biofuels.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, it’s the power sector that will continue to account for the majority of energy related freshwater use. It’s important to realize that different technologies have a very different impact on water use in the power sector. In particular, the type of cooling system used in a power plant is a major determinant of the total quantity of water needed to generate electricity.</p> \n<p>The energy source also matters. For example, it can be much more water intensive to generate electricity from coal and nuclear than gas. So growing the share of gas-fired power could help to reduce the overall freshwater intensity of electricity generation. And replacing coal-fired power with gas can also help to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by around half.</p> \n<p>A second emerging theme is the importance of geographical location. That may sound obvious, but you only have to look at biofuels to see why this matters. Biofuels may offer the fastest route to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions in the road transport sector. But growing biofuels feedstocks in water-stressed areas could mean that their overall social and environmental impact is far from positive. That’s why it’s preferable to source feedstocks in countries like Brazil, where agricultural systems are fed mainly by rainwater, rather than irrigation.</p> \n<p>A third observation is that the world must address some unexpected dilemmas, such as the tension between reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and conserving water supplies. Biofuels are just one example. Another is nuclear power, which can deliver substantial CO<sub>2</sub> reduction benefits, while taking a heavy toll on freshwater resources in some regions.</p><h2>Potential solutions</h2><p>So how do we begin to solve this resource consumption puzzle? <br />&nbsp; <br />Innovation and technology will clearly be critical. The energy industry already employs some highly effective water technologies. And we’re getting better at recovering and recycling water, including waste water from communities close to operations. For example at Shell’s Groundbirch tight gas project in Canada, we are funding a water recycling plant for the nearby city of Dawson Creek. The plant will treat sewage water so that it can be re-used in our operations, and for other industrial and municipal purposes, such as water for sports fields.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then there’s our giant new Pearl gas-to-liquids project in the Qatari desert. This converts natural gas into high value liquid fuels and chemical feed stocks. The chemical reaction that turns the gas into liquids also produces a large amount of water and heat. So at Pearl we built a system that enables us to harness these by-products to drive the plant’s equipment with steam. Thus we avoid drawing on Qatar’s precious water resources.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At Shell, we’re also making progress on biofuels. We’re investing in Brazilian sugarcane ethanol through Raizen, our joint venture with Cosan. Brazilian sugarcane needs virtually no irrigation water to grow because of high seasonal rainfall. And Raizen uses a system that recycles 90% of the water used in the industrial process.</p> \n<p>But it will take more than technological innovation to ease the strain on the world’s water and energy resources.</p> \n<p>New forms of collaboration between the public and private spheres will also be necessary.<br />&nbsp;<br />We need partnerships that marry the commercial expertise of the private sector with the public sector’s understanding of regulatory economics. We need partnerships that remain impartial, and that don’t fall under the influence of one interest group.&nbsp; And we need partnerships that make a tangible impact on the policy-making process, commanding the confidence of some of the world’s most senior political and business leaders.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I could be talking about the World Water Forum.</p> \n<p>I’ll finish by affirming that at Shell we look forward to continuing to work with the Forum and its partners in the private and public sectors – not just to deepen our understanding of these daunting challenges, but to make demonstrable progress in addressing them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>",

In this keynote speech to the annual 31st annual CERAWeek Executive Conference in Houston, Peter Voser outlines what the industry and policymakers must do to ensure society fully leverages the many benefits of natural gas. He calls for well-targeted and robustly enforced regulations to ensure tight and shale gas production meets the highest standards. He also urges the industry to do a better job of listening and responding to public concerns about the environmental and operational challenges associated with gas production.</em></p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>The natural gas revolution: a secure, abundant force for good</h2><p>It’s been called “the natural gas revolution,” the “golden age of gas” and the “shale gale”.</p> \n<p>Whatever title we give it, the natural gas story is being rewritten as I speak. It is developing into a far more compelling narrative, one with the potential to change the world for the better.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Thanks to new technology and innovation, today we can affordably tap into vast fields of tight gas and shale gas embedded in rocks deep in the earth, recovering a resource that just a few years ago was considered out of reach.</p> \n<p>Today I will share with you my view on the implications of the natural gas revolution and the role gas can play in meeting our future energy needs as a “secure, abundant force for good”. I will also take a look at what our industry and policymakers need to do now to ensure society benefits from this abundant resource for decades to come.</p> \n<p>You are all well aware of the scope of the global energy challenge. Our world is headed toward what we at Shell describe as a “zone of uncertainty”, a period of significant stress between energy supply and demand between now and 2050.</p> \n<p>Underlying global demand for energy is likely to double or even triple in the first half of this century. The world needs to invest heavily in energy production, both in traditional sources and in renewables.</p> \n<p>Natural gas likely will play a far more significant role in meeting this challenge than we previously assumed. In fact, this year – for the first time – Shell expects to produce more natural gas than oil.</p> \n<p>But while we expect gas to play a larger role in meeting the world’s future energy needs, it’s not entirely clear today how this new story will play out. How will policymakers around the world address its challenges and opportunities?</p> \n<p>Most importantly, can our industry earn the public trust by developing this cleanest fossil fuel responsibly and safely – in a way that protects the environment and reduces greenhouse gases?</p> \n<p>I think we can and will. But we face some hard work ahead.</p><h2>A secure, abundant force for good</h2><p>First, while we all recognise the significance of this opportunity, our industry needs to do a better job of convincing the world that natural gas is a force for good.</p> \n<p>It’s affordable, it’s clean burning and it benefits the economy. It’s a natural ally to renewables like wind and solar. And its supply is diverse, which enhances energy security.</p> \n<p>That last point is particularly significant here in North America. President Obama recently said the United States could become “the Saudi Arabia of natural gas”. That’s no exaggeration. But while the potential of the natural gas boom is dramatic, it is just one chapter in this evolving story.</p> \n<p>The others include: increased oil production from the Gulf of Mexico; potentially huge deposits in Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic; and the growth in tight oil and heavy oil, including oil sands. Together, these developments promise to dramatically improve the outlook for energy security here and elsewhere around the world.</p> \n<p>Production of tight oil in the United States alone has increased five-fold since 2000, helping reverse a nearly 40-year decline in oil production. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently estimated this resource could help increase U.S. oil production by one-fifth in this decade.</p> \n<p>And this is not just a North American story. The addition of these resources to the world’s energy bank, especially natural gas, is already changing global energy dynamics.</p> \n<p>While the Western Hemisphere will still need to import oil, CERA estimates the need could fall by as much as half in this decade. This will mean less oil from the Middle East and West Africa. That oil will instead flow in increasing volumes to Asia.</p> \n<p>As (IHS CERA Chairman) Daniel Yergin has noted, the Western Hemisphere is emerging once again as an energy powerhouse. In his words: “Innovation is redrawing the map of world oil … and remaking our energy future.”</p><h2>Global economic impact</h2><p>The growth of the U.S. energy market also is having a ripple effect, contributing significantly to the economic recovery.</p> \n<p>The President, in his recent State of the Union address, noted natural gas activities alone could support more than 600-thousand U.S. jobs by the end of this decade.</p> \n<p>The new abundance of gas is helping the United States and other countries rebuild their economies and become more competitive. It’s doing this not only through job creation, but by reducing energy costs and boosting other critical industries, such as chemicals manufacturing.</p> \n<p>In fact, several major chemical companies have recently announced plans to open or re-open plants in this country, bucking the trend of recent years.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we have also been working hard to find other ways to use this abundant resource, by investing in the natural gas value chain. Liquefied natural gas for transportation is a great example. LNG holds tremendous promise as a cleaner transport fuel. As an alternative to diesel, it’s a smart way to reduce emissions of sulphur-oxides and particulates.</p> \n<p>For example, in Singapore and the Dutch port of Rotterdam we are looking at opportunities to use LNG as a marine fuel. In western Canada, Shell’s preparing to make LNG available this year to fleet operators along the busy truck route from Calgary to Edmonton.</p> \n<p>We will install a small-scale gas-liquefaction plant in Alberta and dispense LNG at Shell/Flying J truck stops throughout western Canada. Drawing on the region’s natural gas to produce the LNG, we believe fleets on this route could see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 20% on a well-to-wheels basis.</p> \n<p>We are also investigating ways to use LNG as a transport fuel in the rail and mining sectors, as well as in oil and gas drilling. And natural gas can provide a cleaner source of electricity than coal for the world’s growing fleet of electric vehicles, which would further reduce many countries’ need to import oil.</p> \n<p>Another example of the expanding value chain is gas-to-liquids technology, which transforms natural gas into higher-value liquid fuels and chemicals. Shell is a pioneer and leader in GTL technology, with a track record of research and production going back four decades.</p> \n<p>Last year, we opened the world’s largest GTL plant in Qatar. The Pearl GTL plant produces GTL gasoil, a clean-burning diesel-type automotive fuel; GTL kerosene that can be used for jet fuel; and a variety of chemical feedstocks for lubricants, detergents and petrochemicals.</p> \n<p>We think GTL technology could make a lot of sense in North America. It would further reduce the need for imported oil while deriving greater value from this region’s natural gas resources.</p><h2>Safety & environmental Issues</h2><p>So, yes, there are a lot of positives about the gas revolution. But, as you know, we face serious issues around the safety and environmental impact of developing these resources. This has generated increased public scepticism.</p> \n<p>Many of those who live in areas where natural gas is being developed worry that modern production techniques will harm their environment and endanger their health. The irony, of course, is that those techniques are tried and tested – they are what have made the abundance of gas possible.</p> \n<p>And, yes, not all of the concern and criticism is based on facts or rational argument. But it is our reality, and these concerns need to be addressed.</p> \n<p>And let’s be honest: As an industry, we have not always done our best to engage in the public debates about these issues. This has resulted in some misconceptions taking root, especially about the impact of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”.</p> \n<p>We need to do a better job of listening and responding. To this end, Shell last year announced five operating principles for our onshore tight oil and gas operations. These provide a framework for protecting water, air, wildlife and the communities in which we operate.</p> \n<p>We have invited comment on these principles, and we are committed to support regulations consistent with them. Our hope is they can be applied over time to all tight oil and gas operations around the world.</p> \n<p>To that end, the US Energy Secretary’s Shale Gas Production Subcommittee (on which Mr. Yergin sat) examined potential measures to ensure public safety and protect the environment in shale gas production. As it notes in a recent report, “a prudent balance between development and environmental protection is best struck by establishing a strong foundation of regulation and enforcement”.</p> \n<p>The fact is hydraulic fracturing has been performed more than 1.1 million times in the United States alone over the past 60 years. Documented instances of freshwater contamination have been extremely rare.</p> \n<p>When problems have occurred, they were simply due to poorly designed wells. When a well is designed and constructed correctly, groundwater will not be contaminated.</p> \n<p>As an industry, we should insist on strong regulation and enforcement to ensure everyone in the industry does the job right.</p> \n<p>We also support President Obama’s call for regulation to disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids. Indeed, we support regulations to promote transparency and public engagement by the tight and shale gas industry in relation to all of its activities.</p> \n<p>In the United States, Shell already publicly discloses its fracturing fluid chemicals through the FracFocus online registry to the extent permitted under our supplier contracts.</p> \n<p>Another major public concern about hydraulic fracturing is excessive water use. Sound operational practices can keep water consumption to a minimum. We design our operations to reduce the amount of drinkable water we use. Wherever practical, we use non-potable water and recycle water from our operations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That said, it can take twice the amount of fresh water to extract shale gas than conventional gas. But this is not the whole story.</p> \n<p>The extraction phase only accounts for a small fraction of the total amount of water used to generate power. Studies done by Harvard and MIT researchers show the water intensity of shale gas ranks among the lowest of all fuel sources. Across the life cycle, shale gas-fired power consumes only half the volume of fresh water per megawatt hour consumed by coal and nuclear.</p> \n<p>At our operations in Groundbirch in Canada and Pinedale, Wyoming (USA), Shell re-uses gas-processing water for hydraulic fracturing, reducing water use by half.</p> \n<p>A third area of concern is greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane, from shale gas production. Some environmental groups that once supported switching from coal to gas for electricity generation are no longer doing so over concerns about methane leakage.<br />This is an issue we need to take seriously.</p> \n<p>This controversy was sparked by a couple of well-publicised studies that we believe greatly exaggerated the emissions released during the production and distribution of shale gas. They also overlooked the steps the industry takes to contain the amount of methane released during production.</p> \n<p>The International Energy Agency found on a well-to-burner basis, emissions from shale gas exceed those of conventional gas by as little as 3.5% in the best-case scenario and by 12% in the worst.</p> \n<p>At Shell we manage our operations to keep emissions to the lower number. It is obviously in our economic interest to capture as much gas as possible. We know methane releases can be significantly reduced by using proven technologies. For example, at Pinedale, we installed a system to help us stop methane leaks detected with an infrared camera.</p> \n<p>But clearly more research and hard data are needed to understand the true extent of methane releases from the natural gas industry. <br />To that end, Shell is among operators working with the Environmental Defense Fund to accurately measure methane emissions from natural gas production here in the United States.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s also important to remember overall greenhouse gas emissions from shale gas-fired power are still only around half of those from coal, across the lifecycle from production to use.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, the gas revolution offers the world a tremendous opportunity to help meet the growing demand for affordable energy in the coming decades. At the same time, it offers the fastest and cheapest route to reduce power-sector emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> significantly.</p> \n<p>These gas resources , combined with new oil opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, in Arctic Alaska and in deposits of liquid-rich shale and heavy oil, mean North America is positioned to become far more energy secure than it has been in decades.</p> \n<p>This growth in the energy sector, especially the abundance of affordable natural gas, is leading to a rebirth of the petrochemicals industry while helping to make this region’s manufacturing industries more competitive globally.</p> \n<p>The scale of the gas revolution makes it vital that the public discussion and policymaking be based on hard facts and rigorous analysis.</p> \n<p>There are environmental and operational challenges associated with the production of tight and shale gas. But our industry has the expertise to effectively deal with these challenges, especially if we are governed by well-targeted and robustly enforced regulations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s time we address these issues … and get the word out that natural gas is a secure, abundant force for good. As an industry, we need to listen and respond to public concerns, to become more transparent about our operations, to build trust.</p> \n<p>And we need to cooperate with government and non-governmental organisations that have a stake in developing this resource the right way.</p> \n<p>Finally, it’s time to ensure the work of each and every operator is done to the highest standards. The reality is the lowest performer in our industry sets the standard by which we are all judged.</p> \n<p>This “gas revolution,” this “golden age of gas,” this “shale gale” is the best, most promising opportunity we have today to make substantial progress towards a cleaner, more secure, more abundant and more affordable energy supply.</p> \n<p>The story is being rewritten now. But how the final chapters play out will be based not on what we say here today, but on what we do in the months and years ahead.</p> \n<p>Our industry has the talent, the experience and the capability to do the job right. It’s time we make it happen. I’m confident we will.</p> \n<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>",

It’s a pleasure, as always to be back in Louisiana.</p> \n<p>It’s where I started my career, right out of college in 1982, living Uptown on State Street, and I always enjoy coming back here.</p> \n<p>I consider it an honor to have a chance to speak to you today and I look forward to questions you might have for me.</p> \n<p>You may not know this, but other institutions were founded, like you, in 1923, but most of them have fallen by the wayside.&nbsp; The USSR and its experimental calendar of five-day weeks, for example.&nbsp; Also the original Yankee Stadium and the New York Moderation League, created in 1923 to repeal prohibition.</p> \n<p>The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association has outlasted them all, and rightly so.&nbsp; Because you are important to an industry that is vital to Louisiana, to the country, and for that matter, the world.</p><h2>Shell, Louisiana and the industry</h2><p>Certainly you are important to Shell.&nbsp; Shell has more roots in Louisiana than just about any place else in the U.S., with the possible exception of Houston.</p> \n<p>In 1954 our New Orleans office was in the building right next door to where we are this morning, connected to this hotel.</p> \n<p>We hosted receptions in the International Room.&nbsp; The Petroleum Club on the third floor was the place to see and be seen in those early offshore days.</p> \n<p>We were thrilled to be right in the thick of things, and we still are.</p> \n<p>Today, every part of our business operates in this state:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> We’re a major producer in the Gulf of Mexico </li> \n <li> We produce natural gas in the northern part of the state </li> \n <li> Our pipelines run through the state </li> \n <li> We have refineries, chemical plants, terminals and Shell gas stations all over </li> \n <li> We distribute marine fuels and lubricants out of the Port of New Orleans </li> \n <li> We even process asphalt in St. Rose. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>We also have valuable links with Louisiana State University (LSU) and its engineering schools.&nbsp; LSU is a talent pipeline for us – the entire state is really.&nbsp; Through our relationships with the University and with organizations like this one, we’ve undertaken innovative projects from coastal revitalization to advocacy of fresh ideas on policy.</p> \n<p>So Louisiana is, and always has been, a great place for Shell to do business.&nbsp; And every year our sponsorship of Jazz Fest is Shell’s ‘thank you’ to New Orleans and Louisiana – a signal of our belief in the future of this great city.</p> \n<p>Louisiana knows a thing or two about our industry.&nbsp; It appreciates its great wealth in mineral and natural resources.&nbsp; And that’s wealth in terms of dollars, jobs, individual income and stability.</p> \n<p>You understand, like we do, that to meet tomorrow’s energy demand, we’re going to need to do more of what we’re doing today, not less.</p> \n<p>More exploration, more production, more investment in new technologies that make it safer and more efficient.</p><h2>Louisiana’s role in meeting the needs of 9 billion people</h2><p>You’ve all heard the numbers.&nbsp; The world’s energy demand is expected to double by 2050.&nbsp; By then, the population is projected to exceed 9 billion – three times what it was just 50 years ago.</p> \n<p>Our scenario planners tell us that by that time, we could be facing a gap between energy supply and demand equal to the size of the industry’s entire output in 2000.&nbsp; I always have to stop and think about what this really means!</p> \n<p>We describe this gap, this challenge of meeting future demand, as a zone of uncertainty.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That’s because we don’t yet have clear answers to some tough questions.</p> \n<p>Will we have enough energy?&nbsp; Will it be sustainable?&nbsp; Will the average person be able to afford it?&nbsp; What geopolitical factors will influence the security of our supply?&nbsp; And what happens if we can’t reliably access the energy we need?</p> \n<p>Each question poses real challenges, but also, big opportunities – especially here in Louisiana.</p> \n<p>In one of the worst overall economic climates in a generation, Louisiana ranks third – behind only Texas and Florida – in job growth.</p> \n<p>I saw Governor Jindal on Fox News a few weeks ago talking about the 45,000 jobs and the $10 billion in private capital investments in Louisiana every year for the last three years in a row.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Southern Business &amp; Development magazine names Louisiana the “Best State in the South” for economic development.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A lot of this growth is driven by the oil and gas industry including, I’m proud to say, Shell.</p> \n<p>Louisiana is home to our Deepwater business.&nbsp; In the Gulf, our Perdido platform, which started production in March 2010, and the Mars B project, where we aim to start production by 2015, are just two pillars of that business.</p> \n<p>About a week ago, I was talking to a group of people that included members of the National Academies, a few Nobel Prize winners, and many scientists and otherwise experts in their fields.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I know what you are thinking.&nbsp; I should have been listening, not talking!</p> \n<p>Many of the people there were from areas outside of energy – medicine, government policy and others.</p> \n<p>I described Perdido to them this way:&nbsp; “The upstream infrastructure of our business is the biggest, least visible and probably most misunderstood part of what we do.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“For example, one of our newest upstream production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico is one we call Perdido, roughly 400 miles into the Gulf of Mexico from where we sit today.</p> \n<p>“When you think of Perdido, think of a huge cork, a multi-billion dollar cork, made of steel, nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower, weighing as much as 10,000 large family cars, floating on the surface in 8,000 feet of water.</p> \n<p>“Think of that cork holding a large crew of professionals, operating miles of piping, thousands of valves, hundreds of electronic safety sensors.<br />“Think of that cork tethered to the sea floor and a network of wellheads and equipment linked to more than 100 miles of oil and gas pipelines, along-side species of marine life that no human had ever seen before our remotely operated underwater vehicles snapped their photos.</p> \n<p>“Perdido has the capacity to pump roughly 100 kboe/d.&nbsp; To put that in perspective, it’s enough to meet the energy needs of about 2.2 million American households every day.</p> \n<p>“But there are 130 million homes in America.&nbsp; And more than 250 million cars on our roads.&nbsp; And more than six million businesses, large and small.</p> \n<p>“So imagine the number of Perdido’s required to keep our economy running and to maintain our lifestyles, secure our future and create jobs.”</p> \n<p>I hope that it gave them some insight into the capabilities of this industry.</p> \n<p>And Mars B, when it comes online, will be no less spectacular.</p> \n<p>Coming ashore, I know many of you are familiar with our Haynesville gas development.&nbsp; Here’s a quick update:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> We’ve drilled more than 350 vertical and horizontal wells to date </li> \n <li> Since 2008 we’ve lowered drilling costs by ~50 percent </li> \n <li> Completion costs have been lowered ~45 percent and cycle times have been cut by 60 percent. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>And for the state, we see even more opportunity in the technology that turns natural gas into liquid products – like fuels and lubricants – helping not only with the economic challenges of gas development, but also with a critical liquid fuel need and security of supply for the U.S.<br />Ensuring continued growth in natural gas will take the hard work of thousands of skilled workers and technical experts, and a community of supporting contractors and suppliers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You have that kind of community.</p><h2>Commitment and a coherent approach</h2><p>Of course, growing global energy demand also means there’s going to be more competition for energy resources.</p> \n<p>And if the last several years have shown us anything, it’s that people are looking for ways to make their dollars go farther.</p> \n<p>This is why we see safety, efficiency and sustainability as key to our business.&nbsp; Not only do these things represent the right things to do, they enable our growth.</p> \n<p>We don’t see them as constraints, we see them as part of the value of our brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last summer, for example, we released our onshore gas principles to establish how we will operate in the booming natural gas market.</p> \n<p>These principles confirm that we will:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> Design, construct and operate our wells and facilities in a safe and responsible way </li> \n <li> That we will continue to protect groundwater and reduce water in our operations </li> \n <li> That we will protect air quality and control fugitive emissions </li> \n <li> And that we will engage with communities on the social and economic impacts of our operations, helping them take advantage of the huge economic benefits these developments can deliver. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Nobody said we had to do this.&nbsp; We said that we could, and more importantly that we should.&nbsp; And we know it is important to be very transparent about how we do things.&nbsp; It’s our best defense from critics.</p> \n<p>But of course, meeting the energy challenge and safely capturing the value to businesses and communities that our industry can provide depends on more than the commitments of companies like mine and many of yours.</p> \n<p>It depends as well on a coherent approach from government.&nbsp; In the wake of the BP Macondo tragedy, we lost that coherent approach with a moratorium followed by permitting delays and regulatory uncertainty.</p> \n<p>Many of us have been dealing with this.&nbsp; We’ve lost lots of ground and Gulf Coast employment has suffered.&nbsp; But I think I can fairly say now that it is improving.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By our estimates, before Macondo, drilling plan approval averaged about 50 days.&nbsp; After Macondo, it went to more than 200 days, to everyone’s consternation.</p> \n<p>But we may have turned a corner.&nbsp; We started seeing real improvement in December, with the average permit wait down to a little over 100 days.</p> \n<p>This is a heartening trend that we want to encourage and keep it moving in the right direction, dropping back to where it should be.</p> \n<p>We do think we will get there, and we are working hard to make up for what we have lost.</p> \n<p>Shell has always had confidence.&nbsp; We picked up an additional rig during the period when no rigs were working and since have added another which means six floating rigs for us in the Gulf.</p> \n<p>I know many of you are familiar with the Back to Work Coalition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Shell is a member, and through this coalition, we are working with regulators to further streamline the plan evaluation process.&nbsp; That will give operators the assurances we need to make business decisions.</p> \n<p>It will mean approved plans mature into drilling permits in a more predictable way.</p> \n<p>We are grateful for Secretary Angelle’s leadership on this, attending hearings, holding meetings, and generally working tirelessly with BOEM and BSEE<sup>(*)</sup>&nbsp;over the past year, seeking an end to what many of us have considered the “permitorium” that followed the drilling moratorium.</p> \n<p>We understand that the Secretary has taken a prominent role in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Governors Coalition, which now includes seven coastal state governors.</p> \n<p>This new coalition of governors understands that OCS development will provide significant jobs and economic growth.</p> \n<p>Let me say how much I appreciate the challenges that have confronted BOEM and BSEE since their inception.</p> \n<p>Their people have worked hard, under tremendous pressure, and made real progress.</p> \n<p>But I can see the agencies will need more resources, both in numbers and expertise, to handle the volume of applications they receive, and importantly, so that they can deliver permits able to withstand the now inevitable legal challenges.<br />Bottom line:&nbsp; the federal government should fund BOEM and BSEE properly and support efficient, predictable permitting to develop state and national resources.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Let me close by underscoring the fact that our industry is about the economy.&nbsp; Yes, it is about healthy revenue…jobs…strong local communities…and a brighter future for our kids.</p> \n<p>But it is also much more than that.</p> \n<p>For this country and for the world, our business is about supporting a growing global population, lifting whole societies out of poverty, fueling the infrastructure – factories, transportation, agriculture, businesses – that the future will depend on.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we see energy at the heart of enormous global challenges; for example, the integrated nature of water, food and energy.</p> \n<p>Now, we could let the need for those three resources just compete with each other, or we could work with governments, partners from other industry sectors and customers to innovate smarter ways to optimize the supply and use of water, food and energy.</p> \n<p>We are proud of our leadership and growth in oil and gas, finding it, developing it safely and delivering it to market.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And we are also proud of our role in paving the way for innovative energy solutions of the future.&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li> &nbsp;Biofuels, for example </li> \n <li> Techniques for capturing and sequestering carbon </li> \n <li> Energy efficiency solutions for our customers </li> \n <li> And, perhaps someday, even hydrogen fuel on a commercial scale. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>In the 1950’s when the offshore industry first took off in Louisiana, our challenges were much different.&nbsp; But our industry’s importance to New Orleans and Louisiana continues.&nbsp; There may no longer be a Petroleum Club on the third floor of a historic New Orleans hotel, and there may not be the frontier-town atmosphere driving the growth in our industry like there was back then, but I’m glad to know that there are still organizations like LMOGA.&nbsp; And there are still individuals like those of you gathered here today.</p> \n<p>Together, you are doing what needs to be done to enable this vital industry, to help us create value for our communities, and to open doors to energy solutions for tomorrow.</p> \n<p>This conference is about working to do even more of that.&nbsp; And I’m glad to be part of it.</p> \n<p><em>Thank you very much.</em></p><p><sup>(*) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement</sup></p>",

          "maintext": "<p><em>By 2050, the world’s population is expected to hit 9 billion people, up from nearly 7 billion today. </em></p> \n<p><em>As the world’s population grows, as wealth increases and more people escape poverty, and as more and more people move into rapidly expanding cities, there will be increased stress on our energy, water and food resources. </em></p> \n<p><em>Marvin Odum spoke about the future of energy in the context of this multi-dimensional challenge, proposing a far more integrated approach to creating a more sustainable energy future.<br /></em></p><img src=\"http://s05.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/marvin-odum.jpg\" alt=\"Marvin Odum\"/><h2>Meeting the needs of 9 billion people</h2><p>It’s a very great honor to have this chance to share some thoughts with you, and a little humbling, too.</p> \n<p>My credentials for being in a room with The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science lend themselves more to listening to what you have to say than presuming to offer my own modest insights.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, I’d like to take a few minutes to suggest a way of thinking about my business – the business of energy -- in a way that might surprise you, in a way that connects to the vital work you are doing in your respective disciplines.</p> \n<p>Along the way, I’ll offer some perspectives on why the enormous human, environmental and economic challenges of the 21st century cry out for leadership from individuals who are at the top of their game in the fields you represent.</p> \n<p>Let me warn you right up front that I’m going to close with a pretty heavy proposition: namely, that the health, security and sustainability of the world our kids will be sharing with 9 billion neighbors by 2050 depends on people like us, working together now, on smart answers to some tough questions.</p><h2>Shell and the global energy system</h2><p>If you look at my company – Royal Dutch Shell – through a conventional lens you will see the second largest oil and gas business in the world.</p> \n<p>Most people know us best through the products we sell to consumers – gasoline, diesel and engine oils like Quaker State and Pennzoil.&nbsp; That’s not surprising if you consider that Shell actually has more branded retail sites than McDonalds has restaurants.</p> \n<p>But that’s just the very tip of what we do.</p> \n<p>If you look out your seat window before your next airline flight takes off, you might well see a Shell truck pumping jet fuel into your airplane – just one of about 7,000 aircraft we refuel at over 800 airports across 40 countries each day – one every 12 seconds.</p> \n<p>Admittedly, you’ll be less likely to see Shell fuel and lubricant flowing into one of the ships we service in more than 600 ports worldwide.&nbsp; And, you can’t see the 22 million tons of Shell chemicals that go into products you use every day, from detergents to packaging, from carpets to computers.</p> \n<p>But even all these things represent only one end of the value chain we manage.</p> \n<p>In the U.S. alone we move more than two billion barrels of crude oil and refined products annually by way of 16,400 miles of pipeline.</p> \n<p>Worldwide we use 3,000 tanker trucks and 62 ships and barges to get product where people need it – power plants, airports, harbors, Walmarts, Jiffy Lubes, gas stations.</p> \n<p>And before we move it, we refine it – turning natural gas and crude oil into stuff people can actually use… to move things – like cars, planes and ships… to make things – like paints, shampoos, plastics components for medical equipment… and to power things – like computers, washing machines, TVs and X-box consoles.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the U.S. Shell has the capacity to refine more than 1.3 million barrels of product every day using cutting edge chemical, thermal and physical reactions, running at temperatures and pressures that rival any other man-made process on earth.</p> \n<p>But refining still only represents the halfway step in a journey that links the sources of energy to its use.&nbsp; That journey starts further upstream, in reservoirs of oil and gas: under the ground, under water, under ice, in sand, and in layers of shale.</p> \n<p>The upstream infrastructure of our business is the biggest, least visible, and probably most misunderstood part of what we do.</p> \n<p>For example, one of our newest upstream production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico is one we call Perdido – roughly 200 miles southwest of Galveston.</p> \n<p>When you think of Perdido, think of a 55,000 ton cork - nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower and weighing as much as 10,000 large family cars - bobbing on the surface of an 8000 foot deep body of water.&nbsp; Think of that cork holding a crew of professionals operating miles of piping, thousands of valves, hundreds of electronic safety sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Think of that cork tethered to a network of well heads and separators on the sea floor, linked to 107 miles of gas and oil pipelines, alongside species of marine life that no human being had ever seen -- before our remotely operated underwater vehicles snapped their photos.</p> \n<p>Perdido has the capacity to pump roughly 100,000 barrels of crude oil every day.&nbsp; That sounds like a lot, and it is.&nbsp; It’s enough to meet the energy needs of about 2.2 million American households.</p> \n<p>But there are 130 million homes in America.&nbsp; And 250 million cars on our roads.&nbsp; And more than 6 million businesses, small and large.</p> \n<p>So imagine the number of Perdidos required to keep our economy running and to maintain our lifestyles, to secure our future, to create jobs.</p> \n<p>And just in case you thought that was finally the end of the story, it’s not.&nbsp; Because to keep all that energy flowing -- to meet a demand for energy in 2050 that will be double what it is today -- we need to keep finding more of it, exploring in more and more difficult places, using seismic technologies that require the world’s biggest supercomputers to process.</p> \n<p>The picture I hope is forming is of a massive, complicated, expensive, global energy system that stretches from the most remote corners of this planet to the humblest kitchens, classrooms and shops.&nbsp; One in which Shell, alone, invests close to 30 billion dollars of capital every year to grow and maintain.</p> \n<p>By the way, for all that boastful-sounding description of Shell’s size, the actual fraction of the world’s oil and gas my company produces amounts to a grand total of less than 3 percent.</p> \n<p>You have to multiply the scale of Shell by 33, through dozens of major public and private energy companies, hundreds of service and engineering companies and thousands of logistics companies to account for all the energy that the world consumes every day.</p> \n<p>To keep this massive system running safely, responsibly and reliably is a technical challenge that rivals space travel for its sheer, breathtaking scale.</p> \n<p>This audience is better equipped than most to imagine just how technically demanding it is to find, produce, make, move and sell hydrocarbons – working at temperatures that range from 160 degrees below zero Celsius to liquefy natural gas, to more than 800 degrees Celsius to transform crude oil into useful products … at pressures more than 200 times the weight of the air in this room.</p><h2>Energy for Life</h2><p>The theme of your conference this year – “Energy for Life: From Human Metabolism to Powering the Planet” – got me thinking.</p> \n<p>It occurred to me that the enormously complicated energy system we’ve built over the last 100 years or so… that we use to run our cities, factories and economies… is not even as sophisticated as the energy system of a simple, single human cell.</p> \n<p>Nature has designed an energy plant a tenth the diameter of a strand of hair that takes proteins and amino acids and oxygen and converts it through the Krebs cycle with perfect efficiency into the energy we use to work, think, play, and stand up in front of an audience speaking.</p> \n<p>And nature has managed to produce – and reproduce – a nearly infinite number of these microscopic energy plants to fuel life of every sort – from exotic lichens in Antarctica, to beef cattle in south Texas, to 500 year-old Sequoia trees in California.</p> \n<p>And it further occurred to me that if we’re going to stand any chance of meeting the energy needs we’ve created for human societies – a need that will only increase for future generations – we’ll need to find ways of creating systems that take at least a few, crude, man-made steps closer to the self-sustaining, perfectly efficient, zero-waste ideal that nature has managed to produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So how do we do that?</p> \n<p>Well, it starts by reducing the amount of energy we throw away every day.&nbsp; That means ever more efficient cars, trucks, aircraft, factory robots, laptop computers and light bulbs.&nbsp; Everything from kitchen toasters to supertankers will need to consume less energy per unit of work than they do today.</p> \n<p>It also means designing better ways of organizing our lives.</p> \n<p>By 2050, three out of every four people on this Earth will live in cities.&nbsp; That’s up from 50 percent today.&nbsp; That means the equivalent of a new city of a million people every week for the next 30 years.&nbsp; So we have people at Shell working with the planners of some of the biggest, densest urban areas of the world to understand how to design cities that more efficiently and productively provide for human work, education, mobility, education and culture.</p> \n<p>But in case you’re thinking that I’m shifting the burden to someone else – that it’s all about more efficient cars and lifestyles – let me hasten to point out that companies like mine are rolling up their sleeves as well.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we take our responsibility to help address the energy challenge seriously. We’re actively addressing future energy needs and helping customers consume and emit less.</p> \n<p>In addition to delivering breakthrough fuels and lubricants, we’ve developed driving tips for motorists to help them use less fuel.&nbsp; We’ve actually trained more than 200,000 people across the globe on fuel efficiency.</p> \n<p>We’ve developed a new type of bitumen – a petroleum product – that requires much less heat and energy to pave a road than more traditional asphalt.</p> \n<p>We’re constantly introducing better lubricants to reduce waste heat and friction in engines and heavy machinery.</p> \n<p>Fuel efficiency also derives from producing and moving it more efficiently, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We’ve adopted, for example, operating principles for how we produce natural gas from tight sands and shale formations.</p> \n<p>These principles cover:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> Designing, constructing and operating our wells and facilities safely and responsibly; </li> \n <li> Protecting groundwater and reducing our water use in the process; </li> \n <li> Protecting air quality and controlling emissions – including greenhouse gases that cause climate change; </li> \n <li> Reducing the physical footprint of our operations; </li> \n <li> And engaging with communities on the social impacts of our operations… helping them take advantage of the economic benefits these developments can deliver. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Although we’ve designed these particular principles for our onshore gas business, they are similar to the way we operate everywhere from the Gulf of Mexico, to oil sands in Canada, to our Arctic exploration in Alaska.</p> \n<p>We’re also finding ways to be more efficient in finding and producing oil and gas – using new techniques that can only be described in highly technical terms, like “really cool.”</p> \n<p>For example, researchers from Shell and HP will work together on tiny “nano” motion sensors – a thousand times more sensitive than those in the Wii electronic game – to create sharper pictures of underground rock formations.</p> \n<p>At the other end of the scale is new Floating Liquefied Natural Gas technology that includes vessels six times the size of the biggest aircraft carriers that can reduce the volume of gas by a factor of 600 and send it on its way to markets anywhere in the world.</p> \n<p>But I can guess the question that is still on the tip of many of many of your tongues: “Why only fossil fuels?&nbsp; Great that you’re working to minimize the impact of fracking and oil sands and offshore drilling, but what about alternatives?&nbsp; Hydrogen?&nbsp; Biofuels?&nbsp; Wind?&nbsp; Solar?”</p> \n<p>Well, the answer is that those alternatives are tremendously exciting.&nbsp; The answer is that they will be – that they must be – a significant part of our energy system.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And the answer is that we’re actively working on them.</p> \n<p>For example, last year we formed a $12 billion joint venture in Brazil producing 2 billion liters of biofuels every year.&nbsp; The sugar-cane based ethanol we’re producing there is the most sustainable, least carbon-intensive biofuel available anywhere at such a scale.</p> \n<p>What’s more, our JV could be a platform for commercializing far more technically advanced – so-called next generation – biofuels that we’re working on with partners in the U.S. and Canada.</p> \n<p>You’ve already heard from Dick Williams this morning about the potential we see in wind.</p> \n<p>We’re exploring how best we might someday bring hydrogen fuel to our retail markets when the auto industry is ready for it.</p> \n<p>Solar, nuclear, geothermal and tidal power will all be part of the world’s future energy portfolio, too.&nbsp; We’ll need them all.&nbsp; And Shell could make a contribution to more of them than you might expect.</p> \n<p>But replacing any meaningful fraction of today’s fossil fuel system with alternatives will require major technological breakthroughs, investments, infrastructure changes, public education and intelligent policy frameworks.</p> \n<p>Most current projections show that roughly 30 percent of our energy will come from alternatives to oil and gas by the middle of this century.</p> \n<p>Frankly, I think that figure ought to be much higher.&nbsp; But just as frankly, I don’t yet see how we get there.</p> \n<p>So we continue to work on all fronts, making sure that we don’t sacrifice the best solutions available today to the ideal solutions we imagine for tomorrow.</p> \n<p>We continue to work on getting a few steps closer to that ideal energy system nature designed into the human cell.</p> \n<p>And we continue to expand our thinking about the role that energy – and energy companies – play in the bigger scheme of things.</p> \n<p>Because just as that human cell is a system within much larger systems that add up to our ability to think, and feel, and work and metabolize; so is our industry a system within a much larger integrated system that adds up to the ability of the planet and its resources to support our communities and economies.</p><h2>The water/food/energy nexus</h2><p>We need to take an especially close look at the nexus between water, food and energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a powerful interplay between the three.</p> \n<p>Increasingly it takes energy to produce dwindling supplies of fresh water.&nbsp; It takes water – and lots of it – to produce certain kinds of energy.&nbsp; And it takes both water and energy to produce food in the increasing quantities needed to support a growing population.</p> \n<p>We could let the need for those three resources compete with each other or we could work with governments, partners from other industry sectors, and customers to innovate smarter ways to optimize the supply and use of water, food and energy.</p> \n<p>That’s why at Shell we’re actively developing innovative new technologies for reducing the water we use in our drilling and production operations.&nbsp; It’s why we’re developing biofuels only in places where they don’t compete with food and water supplies, and learning ways to produce tomorrow’s biofuels from agricultural waste.</p> \n<p>And it’s why we’re so focused on ways to tackle CO2 emissions that drive climate changes that could radically affect future availability of water supplies, agricultural patterns, and demand for energy.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Which finally brings me to the proposition I threatened you with at the beginning of this talk… and that is that it will take the integrated leadership of people like you and me -- in professions as diverse as medicine, engineering, science and business -- working together across sectors and disciplines, to tackle the enormous challenges and opportunities confronting us in this still-new century.</p> \n<p>And there’s enough of Texas in my DNA to further suggest that there are few more logical homes for that kind work and thinking than right here, supported by organizations like this Academy.&nbsp; That’s not just a Texas swagger.&nbsp; That’s recognition of this state’s responsibility in the world as a big place, with big ideas, big resources, big appetites and a big heart.</p> \n<p>We are, in my view, the energy capital of the world, and when the world looks for ways to tackle the challenges of energy – from human metabolism to powering the planet – they ought to find some of the best answers right here.</p>",

          "summary": "<p>Speech given by Simon Henry, Chief Financial Officer, Royal Dutch Shell plc, at the 7th Meeting of the OECD Forum on Tax Administration,  Buenos Aires, Argentina on January 18, 2012.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p><em>In the&nbsp;wake of the global financial crisis, there is much debate about whether large businesses pay their fair share of tax. In this speech, Simon Henry, the CFO of Royal Dutch Shell, describes the scale of Shell’s tax contribution, and why setting tax rates for the energy industry can be a complex task that must take account of the level of investment and risk required to develop oil and gas fields. Simon also explains why closer co-operation between the tax authorities and major taxpayers, in accordance with the Forum on Tax Administration’s guidelines, is beneficial for all parties. Such co-operation allows the authorities to receive revenues much more quickly and cheaply. And it provides energy companies like Shell with greater certainty for their investments.</em></p><img src=\"http://s03.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240x178/simon-henry.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Henry\"/><h2>Shell and corporate tax</h2><p>I should thank the Forum on Tax Administration for your invitation for me to speak today – and for your valuable work in building bridges between tax administrations and taxpayers at a time of uncertainty for us all. Today, I’ll explain why we, at Shell, welcome closer relationships with the tax authorities and I’ll make a few suggestions about how to smooth the path of co-operation.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shell and taxation</h2><p>But you first asked me to place the issue of tax in its broader context, and to provide a brief overview of our current business conditions and challenges.</p> \n<p>It’s now clear that the world has entered a prolonged era of macro-economic volatility.</p> \n<p>In 2012, the big story is again the Eurozone debt crisis: the Eurozone may now have slipped back into recession and Europe’s banking system remains extremely fragile. Elsewhere, the recovery in the US remains sluggish, despite tentative signs of improvement in the labour market. And a number of important emerging markets face flagging growth and high inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />That’s not all. 2012 has already highlighted that geo-political risks also cloud the horizon with the tension surrounding Iran pushing up oil prices. This is also a reminder that high and volatile energy prices will be with us for the foreseeable future as long-term demand for energy surges and supplies come under pressure.</p> \n<p>On top of all this, businesses must adapt to a wave of new financial regulation. This year in the US, for example, many of the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions are likely to come into effect across a wide range of areas from consumer finance to over-the-counter derivatives. Meanwhile, the EU is working on its own regulatory overhaul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />So what does this mean from my point of view, as the CFO of an energy company like Shell?</p> \n<p>It means maintaining a sound balance sheet appropriate to an era of macro-economic volatility - while investing billions of dollars in developing new energy sources. It means managing risk across all areas of business activity -- from complying with financial regulations to the safety risks associated with producing oil and gas in challenging locations, such as the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. And it means adapting Shell’s businesses to leaner times, while laying the foundations for future growth -- sometimes in unfamiliar growth markets and in new areas of business activity, such as biofuels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Against this backdrop, predictable and transparent tax regimes can be a welcome source of stability – especially so in the energy industry where our investment lifecycles span decades.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><br />But there’s another, broader reason why tax is currently such an important issue for Shell. The global economic crisis is forcing a re-evaluation of more than just the financial services sector.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There’s a sense that capitalism itself has reached a turning point and that something is broken in the contract between government, society and business.</p> \n<p>You can see that in everything from the surge in financial regulation in Washington to the “Occupy Wall Street” protests. As part of this, there’s a highly charged debate about whether international companies like Shell avoid paying our fair share of tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now, there’s no doubt that the business sector must strive to preserve and strengthen public confidence in its activities. But the debate on tax can all too easily be coloured by misunderstanding.</p> \n<p>At a basic level, it’s the responsibility of policymakers to determine what a fair share of tax is. And it’s our responsibility as businesses to pay these taxes and to uphold the law.<br />&nbsp;<br />But in the energy industry, determining what a “fair” tax rate might be is a difficult balancing act, and one that must take account of the level of investment and risk involved in developing an oil or gas field.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, a high tax rate might be appropriate in a Middle Eastern country holding substantial and easily accessible resources. But it’s a different story in, say, the North Sea, where oil and gas fields are smaller, more technically challenging, and less profitable for companies to develop. A very high tax rate there might simply make these resources commercially unviable to produce.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The same is true of the debate about “tax havens”. Here again, it’s for sovereign nations to determine their own tax rates in accordance with the revenues they want to generate. And businesses like Shell are perfectly entitled to operate in low-tax jurisdictions for legitimate business purposes.</p> \n<p>What we must do is to co-operate with the authorities and other businesses to help stamp out illegal activity in these countries. And the OECD has been doing much good work to encourage this kind of co-operation and exchange of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These are some of the points that are often lost in the public and political controversy about tax. And I believe that you, the tax authorities, can help to inject a note of reason and moderation here.</p> \n<p>The reality is that we, at Shell, have every incentive to pay our fair share of tax and to be transparent about doing so. There is, quite simply, no better way to highlight our industry’s role as a powerful engine of government revenues, employment and growth. And thus to remind people that profitable and well-run businesses are essential to healthy societies.&nbsp;</p><h2>The energy industry and its broader economic contribution</h2><p>In 2010 Shell paid more than&nbsp;$15 billion in corporate taxes and we collected more than $80 billion in excise duties and sales taxes on our fuel and other products on behalf of governments. And that does not include the royalties, payroll, property and other taxes that we pay.</p> \n<p>There’s also a story about the developing economies. In Nigeria, for example, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria is the operator of a joint venture between the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell, Total and Agip. Between 2006 and 2010, the joint venture paid the Nigerian government revenues totalling some $31 billion. And the Nigerian government receives 95% of the revenue after costs from each barrel of oil it produces.</p> \n<p>But the energy industry’s economic contribution extends far beyond its own payment of taxes. At Shell, we invested nearly $30 billion in developing and delivering new energy supplies in 2011. We also spent an estimated $62 billion with third party suppliers around the world last year. All of which is a powerful driver of prosperity and employment in countries across the world.</p><h2>Efficient and straightforward tax regimes: supporting investment</h2><p>When you consider the scale of this contribution, you can see why we, at Shell, are happy to be transparent about the amount of tax we pay.</p> \n<p>You can also see why predictable tax regimes that incentivise investment are so important, not just to the energy industry, but to society as a whole. Just now, they matter more than ever: enormous deficits are prompting some governments to pursue a more short-term and volatile approach to tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But another critical element of these regimes is how the authorities apply the law, and whether they do so in an efficient, consistent and predictable manner. All of which explains Shell’s commitment to closer co-operation with the authorities.</p> \n<p>I’m talking about co-operation that follows the FTA’s guidelines: we provide the authorities with timely and comprehensive information on potential tax issues -- in return for treatment that is impartial, proportionate, open, responsive and grounded in an understanding of our commercial environment. Thus we are able to settle tax issues upfront, giving us, the business, the certainty we need to begin arranging financing and other corporate and operational structures.</p> \n<p>From our point of view, such relationships offer the best chance of efficient and predictable tax regimes for our investments. And they help us to comply with the law, and to manage our tax-related risks – which are just one set of the risks that we face in our day-to-day activities. <br />A word on what we don’t expect from closer co-operation: we don’t expect to get everything our own way or to enter into “sweetheart deals”, in other words deals that allow us to avoid complying with the tax laws of the countries in which we operate.</p> \n<p>For the tax authorities, closer co-operation offers the most efficient route to raising revenues. In particular, it reduces the need for lengthy and expensive audits, so that you are free to focus on your most important risks and the real miscreants engaged in tax evasion and fraud.</p><h2>Building co-operative relationships</h2><p>All this has certainly been the story of Shell’s relationships with the Dutch and UK tax authorities over the past five years.</p> \n<p>At the outset, I was surprised by the degree of mutual misunderstanding. But we have long since moved beyond this to build strong and co-operative relationships. And we’re now taking this a stage further with a tri-partite - or “three-way” – relationship to resolve cross-border tax issues affecting taxpayers operating in the two countries. This has already brought important benefits. For example, in 2009, we moved some of our gas trading and marketing operations to the UK from the Netherlands. And we resolved the associated cross-border tax issues within months, avoiding a costly audit.</p> \n<p>And it’s great to see more tax authorities appreciating the benefits of closer co-operation. At Shell we were delighted to accept Austria’s invitation to participate in its new pilot scheme. <br />So what are some of the critical steps to effective co-operation?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>First, there should be genuine commitment to the relationship from both sides. That has to come from the top: from us, as CFOs, and from you, as tax commissioners.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A second step must be the development of mutual trust, underpinned by rigorous controls and audit procedures. At Shell, this is provided by our tax control framework. This in turn is just one part of our wider business control framework, which manages and mitigates risk across all areas of business activity. That includes the safety and environmental risks we face in locations like the Russian sub-Arctic. Under the framework, we regularly test our tax controls, which are also audited by our external auditors. And as part of our enhanced relationships, we are happy to share our internal results with tax authorities, even if they did not show us in a flattering light.</p> \n<p>The third, and most obvious, requirement is that the co-operation should be mutually beneficial and reduce costs for both sides: so businesses should be demonstrably transparent, while tax authorities should resolve tax issues more swiftly.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Let me sum up. Businesses and governments are in an era of strong volatility –- one in which stable and predictable tax frameworks are critical to maintaining the right conditions for much-needed business investment.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is especially true in the energy industry, which - while profitable - already makes an enormous contribution to tax revenues, employment and prosperity around the world.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />If companies and the tax authorities can work together in a spirit of trust, transparency and mutual understanding then all parties will benefit. Businesses will enjoy stronger conditions for investment, and government exchequers will receive their revenues more quickly and cheaply. And that is surely a prize worth striving for.</p> \n<p><br /><em>Thank you.</em></p>",

Second quarter 2013 earnings included an identified net charge of $2.2 billion after tax, mainly reflecting impairments (see page 6).<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Second quarter 2013 CCS earnings excluding identified items (see page 6), were $4.6 billion and included a combined negative impact of $0.7 billion after tax related to the impact of the weakening Australian dollar on a deferred tax liability and the impact of the deteriorating operating environment in Nigeria. Compared to the second quarter 2012, CCS earnings excluding identified items were also impacted by higher operating expenses and depreciation as well as increased exploration well write-offs. Second quarter 2012 CCS earnings excluding identified items were $5.7 billion.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Basic CCS earnings per share excluding identified items decreased by 21% versus the same quarter a year ago.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter 2013 was $12.4 billion, compared with $13.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Excluding working capital movements, cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter 2013 was $8.4 billion, compared with $9.5 billion in the second quarter 2012.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Capital investment for the second quarter 2013 was $11.3 billion. Net capital investment (see Note 1) for the quarter was $10.9 billion.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Total dividends distributed in the quarter were $2.8 billion, of which some $0.8 billion were settled under the Scrip Dividend Programme. During the second quarter some 56.2 million shares were bought back for cancellation for a consideration of $1.9 billion.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Gearing at the end of the second quarter 2013 was 10.3% (see Note 2).<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>A second quarter 2013 dividend has been announced of $0.45 per ordinary share and $0.90 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”), an increase of 5% compared with the second quarter 2012.<br /> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Summary of unaudited results</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>Quarters</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>$ million</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>Half year</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>Q2 2013</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>Q1 2013</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Q2 2012<b><sup>1</sup></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>%<sup>2</sup></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>2013</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>2012<b><sup>1</sup></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>%</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>1,737</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>8,176</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4,083</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>57</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>Income attributable to shareholders</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>9,913</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>12,820</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>23</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>657</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>(225)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>1,901</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>Current cost of supplies (CCS) adjustment for Downstream</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>432</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>841</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>2,394</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>7,951</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5,984</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>60</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>CCS earnings </b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>10,345</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>13,661</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>24</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>(2,206)</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>431</p> </td> \n   <td><p>245</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>Less: Identified items<sup>3</sup></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>(1,775)</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>625</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>4,600</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>7,520</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5,739</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>20</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>CCS earnings excluding identified items</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>12,120</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>13,036</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>-</b><b>7</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Of which:</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><b>3,526</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p>5,648</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4,527</p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </td> \n   <td><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These results were undermined by a number of factors – but they were clearly disappointing for Shell“, continued Voser.</p> \n<p>Oil theft and disruptions to gas supplies in Nigeria are causing widespread environmental damage, and could cost the Nigerian government $12 billion in lost revenues per year. “We will play our part, but these are problems Shell cannot solve alone,” Voser said.</p> \n<p>“We’ve made substantial improvements to our portfolio in the last few years. Today, Shell is rich with new investment opportunities and is capital constrained – the opposite position to where the company was in the middle of the last decade.”</p> \n<p>“Shell is investing in new capacity worldwide, to generate profitable growth for shareholders. In the next 18 months we expect to see five major project start-ups, which should add over $4 billion to our 2015 cash flow<i><sup>(1)</sup></i>.</p> \n<p>We’ve embedded rigorous portfolio management into Shell, to improve our capital efficiency and refresh the portfolio for growth. We have completed some $21 billion of divestments in the last three years and some $4 billion in the last 12 months alone, with more to come.</p> \n<p>Shell is entering a new phase of more substantial portfolio change, which will lead to a higher rate of divestments in the coming years.</p> \n<p>We have recently launched strategic portfolio reviews in both Nigeria onshore and North America resources plays, which will lead to further focus and divestments there, as we continue to shape the company for the future.</p> \n<p>Our strategy is to deliver sustainable growth in cash generation through the business cycle, underpinning Shell’s competitive dividends and returns. We are not targeting oil and gas production volumes; rather we are focusing on financial performance.”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded, “Shell’s sustained investment in new growth projects will drive our financial performance. Dividends are Shell’s main route for returning cash to shareholders and we have distributed more than $11 billion of dividends in the last 12 months.

Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of&nbsp; RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.<br /> </p><h2>Scrip Dividend Programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.&nbsp; Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on www.shell.com/scrip.<br /> </p><h2>Dividend timetable for the second quarter 2013 interim dividend</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>2nd quarter 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Announcement date</td> \n   <td>August 1, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Ex-divident date</td> \n   <td>August 14, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Record date</td> \n   <td>August 16, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Scrip reference share price announcement date</td> \n   <td>August 21, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Closing of scrip election and currency election (*)</td> \n   <td>September 2, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</td> \n   <td>September 9, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Payment date</td> \n   <td>September 26, 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i><br /> * A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom and their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.</p> \n<p>The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the second quarter 2013 interim dividend of US$0.45 is US$0.05 per ordinary share and the dividend and tax credit together amount to US$0.50.

          "summary": "The Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc (“RDS”) today announced the Reference Share Price in respect of the first quarter interim dividend of 2013, which was announced on May 2nd, 2013 at $0.45 per A ordinary share (“A Share”) and B ordinary share (“B Share”) and $0.90 per American Depository Share (“ADS”).\n",
          "maintext": "<h2>Reference Share Price</h2><p>The Reference Share price is used for calculating a Participating Shareholder’s entitlement under the Scrip Dividend Programme, as defined below.<br /> <br /> </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>Q1 2013 </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Reference share price (US$)</td> \n   <td>33.944<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>The Reference Share Price is the US dollar equivalent of the average of the closing price for the Company’s A Shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam for the five dealing days commencing on (and including) the date on which the Shares are first quoted ex-dividend in respect of the relevant dividend.<br /> </p> \n<p>The Reference Share Price is calculated by reference to the Euronext Amsterdam closing price in euro. The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.<br /> <br /> </p><h2>Reference ADS Price</h2><p>ADS stands for “American Depositary Share”. ADR stands for “American Depositary Receipt”. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably). ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.<br /> </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td> \n   <td>Q1 2013</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Reference ADS price (US$)<br /> </td> \n   <td>67.888<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS. A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary. Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price. The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs and B ADSs.<br /> </p> \n<p>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme. Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website: <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.<br /> </p><h2>Scrip dividend programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br /> </p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br /> </p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br /> </p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br /> </p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.<br /> </p>",

          "maintext": "<h2>Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser commented:</h2><p>&nbsp;“Our industry continues to see significant energy price volatility as a result of economic and political developments. Oil prices have fallen recently but Shell is implementing a long-term, competitive and innovative strategy against this volatile backdrop.”</p> \n<p>“Shell's underlying CCS earnings were $7.5 billion for the quarter, a 2% increase in CCS earnings per share from the first quarter of 2012. These results were underpinned by Shell's growth projects, an improvement in downstream profitability, and were delivered despite a difficult security environment in Nigeria.”</p> \n<p>“Our profits pay for Shell's dividends and investment in new projects to ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies for our customers, and to add value for our shareholders.”</p> \n<p>“Shell is investing for profitable growth, whilst maintaining strong capital discipline. We are developing some 30 new projects and maturing a series of further opportunities for investment. So far this year, we’ve seen the growth impact of recent start ups and we took four final investment decisions in petrochemicals, deepwater, and LNG.”</p> \n<p>“We continue to take a dynamic approach to portfolio” continued Voser. “Asset sales - $0.6 billion in the first quarter and over $21 billion in the last three years - improve our capital efficiency and can bring in strategic partners. We use selective acquisitions to refresh our opportunity set.”</p> \n<p>Voser commented “We distributed $11 billion of dividends over the last year, the highest in our industry, and today we confirm a 5% rise in our dividend to $0.45 per share.”</p> \n<p>He concluded “Dividends are Shell’s main route for returning cash to shareholders. Our improving cash flow also enables us to accelerate our share buyback programme, this year so far we have repurchased some $1.2 billion of shares by the end of April. In the current environment we would expect to more than offset the scrip dividend issue this year, and we are determined to implement the policy to offset dilution over the business cycle. This underlines our commitment to shareholder returns.”</p><img src=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/investor/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>First quarter 2013 results video comment</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/financial-information/quarterlyresults/2013/1st-quarter-2013-unaudited-results/video.html\">Watch Simon Henry, Chief Financial Officer of Royal Dutch Shell plc, comment on the 2013 first quarter results</a></li></ul><h2>First quarter 2013 results documents</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/financial-information/quarterlyresults/2013/1st-quarter-2013-unaudited-results.html\">Online version of Quarterly Results Announcement (results in full)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s06.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-qra.pdf\">PDF of Quarterly Results Announcement (results in full)</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure.xls\">Excel of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure.pdf\">PDF of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li></ul><h2>Restatement of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</h2><p>This version of the Supplementary financial and operational disclosure shows variances compared with previously-published information for periods Q4 2008-Q4 2012, as a result of the adoption of revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits on January 1, 2013, with retrospective effect.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure-restatement.pdf\">PDF of restatement of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s03.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-suppl-finandopdisclosure-restatement.xls\">Excel of restatement of Supplementary financial and operational disclosure</a></li></ul><h2>First quarter 2013 results webcast</h2><p>Simon Henry, Chief Financial Officer of Royal Dutch Shell hosted audio webcasts of the first quarter results 2013 on Thursday May 2 2013.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://cache.merchantcantos.com/webcast/static/ec2mc/4000/5275/5345/10816/Lobby/default.htm\">Media webcast</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cache.merchantcantos.com/webcast/static/ec2mc/4000/5275/5345/10812/Lobby/default.htm\">Analyst webcast</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-analyst-presentation-transcript.pdf\">PDF of transcript of presentation to analysts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-media-presentation-transcript.pdf\">PDF of transcript of presentation to media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/quarterly-results/2013/q1/q1-2013-presentation-slides-final.pdf\">PDF of presentation slides</a></li></ul><p><sup>* If you are accessing this page on an iPad or iPhone,&nbsp;please download&nbsp;and install our </sup><a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/news-and-library/follow-us/app.html\"><sup>Investor &amp; Media app</sup></a><sup> and go to the Results section to listen to these webcasts.</sup></p><h2>First quarter 2013 dividend announcement</h2><a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/dividend-information/historical-payments/2013/q1.html\">First quarter 2013 interim dividend announcement</a>",

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br /> <br /> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

          "summary": "The Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc (“RDS”) today announced an interim dividend in respect of the fourth quarter 2012 of US$0.43 per A ordinary share (“A Share”) and B ordinary share (“B Share”), an increase of US$ 0.01on the equivalent US dollar dividend for the same quarter last year.",
          "maintext": "<p>The Board expects that the first quarter 2013 interim dividend will be US$0.45, an increase of 4.7% over the US dollar dividend for the same quarter in the previous year. The first quarter 2013 interim dividend is scheduled to be announced on May 2, 2013.<br /> <br /> RDS provides eligible shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme (“the Programme”). For further details please see below.</p><h2>Details relating to the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group. </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ordinary share</th> \n   <th>Q4 2012</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.43</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.43</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p> \n<p>Cash dividends on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p> \n<p>The pounds sterling and euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on March 8, 2013.<br /> </p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ADS</th> \n   <th>Q4 2012</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.86</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.86</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) will be paid, by default, in US dollars.<br /> <br /> ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.<br /> <br /> </p><h2>Scrip Dividend Programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br /> <br /> Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends, if approved by the Board. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br /> <br /> Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.<br /> <br /> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h2>Dividend timetable for the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><br /><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>&nbsp;</th> \n   <th><p>4th quarter 2012</p> </th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Announcement date</th> \n   <td>Jan 31, 2012<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Ex-dividend date</th> \n   <td>Feb 13, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Record date&nbsp;</th> \n   <td>Feb 15, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th> \n   <td>Feb 20, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><i><b>(*)</b></i></sup></th> \n   <td>Mar 1, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</th> \n   <td>Mar 8, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Payment date</th> \n   <td>Mar 28, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i><br /> * A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Please contact your broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial institution where you hold your securities account for the election deadline that applies.</i></p><h2>Taxation cash dividends</h2><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be subject to the deduction of Netherlands dividend withholding tax at the rate of 15%, which may be reduced in certain circumstances. Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.<br /> <br /> Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom and their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.<br /> <br /> The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend of US$0.43 is US$0.05 per ordinary share and the dividend and tax credit together amount to US$0.48. The pounds sterling and euro equivalents will be announced on March 8, 2013.<br /> </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><b>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br /> The Hague, January 31st, 2013</b><br /> </p><h2>Contacts</h2><p><b>Investor Relations&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>Europe: &nbsp;+ 31 70 377 4540<br /> USA: +1 713 241 1042</p> \n<p><b><br /> Media<br /> </b>Europe: &nbsp;+ 31 70 377 3600</p> \n<p><br /> <br /> <b>Cautionary note<br /> </b>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.&nbsp; Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" title=\"www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

This is how I feel when I return to Beijing every year. So thank you, my friends, for inviting me back. It is always a sincere honour and pleasure to address this distinguished forum.</p> \n<p>Today I want to share some thoughts about our collective future – in particular, about the challenges we face in developing a secure, more resilient and more sustainable energy system. I am also here to learn from you, so I am looking forward to a robust discussion following my remarks. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>To begin, I would like to share three things with you.</p> \n<p>First, I will provide an overview of the latest report from Shell’s scenarios team. It provides a detailed analysis of how economic, social and political forces might play out through this century and how those forces could affect the evolution of the global energy system.</p> \n<p>Second, I will focus on China and the steps the government is taking to deliver more energy and cleaner energy.</p> \n<p>Finally, I will briefly discuss the ways in which Shell and China are working together to meet the energy objectives of the Chinese government.</p><h2>New Lens Scenarios</h2><p>Let’s begin with what we at Shell are calling the “New Lens Scenarios”.</p> \n<p>For 40 years, our scenarios team has sought to understand how the future might unfold, to improve our understanding of global developments and their potential impact on our energy system. The scenarios cannot predict the future, but they can give us the tools to anticipate what could happen. In other words, they deepen our strategic thinking. And we share this thinking with governments, researchers, academia and the public around the world.</p> \n<p>It’s clear the combination of a growing population and rising prosperity as millions more people emerge from poverty will continue to drive a sharp increase in global energy demand. By 2060, our planet could be home to 9.5 billion people, up from 7 billion today.&nbsp; That is the equivalent of adding one new city of nearly 1.5 million people every week for the next four decades.</p> \n<p>In the next seven years alone, the world’s additional energy demand could be equal in size to China’s entire energy demand today. Rising demand will also place more stress on our water and food systems, and on the climate and our environment. That is because these resources are all tightly interconnected.</p> \n<p>To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many governments have introduced stricter environmental legislation and incentives to drive the development of renewable energy sources. Shell’s scenarios team estimates that by 2035, the world’s renewable energy sources could grow by at least 60% or even double. By 2060, renewable energy could supply up to four times more energy than today, which would be a staggering rate of expansion.</p> \n<p>Even so, fossil fuels will continue to supply the majority of energy demand for decades to come due to the sheer scale of that demand. Our scenarios team expects fossil fuel consumption to rise by about one-third over the next two decades. And by 2060, fossil fuels are still likely to meet around 60% of global demand, though that would be down from about 80% today.</p> \n<p>One of our scenarios sees a world strongly shaped by market forces in which oil, gas and coal continue to play a major role, as do renewables after 2030. But in this scenario, coordinated action to address climate change comes slowly. As a result, coal use continues to rise for decades with a resulting rise in CO₂ emissions.</p> \n<p>In the other scenario, the world is strongly influenced by government policies and the abundance of natural gas. Natural gas becomes the most important energy source globally by the 2030s. This is combined with coordinated global efforts to limit CO₂ emissions, such as government support for carbon capture and storage.</p><h2>Three step we can take now</h2><p>In looking at our future energy challenge, we believe three actions can be taken now to get us firmly on the road toward a more sustainable energy system:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> First, we need to take advantage of the world’s abundant natural gas resources and reduce coal consumption;<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>&nbsp;Second, governments must support development of carbon capture and storage technology to make fossil fuel use cleaner;<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>And third, we need to promote smarter urban planning to reduce energy demand, especially in transportation.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>I am convinced natural gas will play a major role in fostering a cleaner and more sustainable energy system.</p> \n<p>Gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel; its supply is abundant and diverse. The International Energy Agency estimates there is enough technically available gas to last 250 years at today’s consumption levels. In fact, our scenarios team estimates gas could become the world’s largest energy source by the 2030s.</p> \n<p>When used to generate power, natural gas produces about half the CO₂ emissions of coal. We can see the evidence of this benefit in the United States. The abundance of low-cost gas there – thanks to the revolution in shale gas – has led electric utilities to switch from coal on a broad scale. This in turn has contributed to a significant reduction in CO₂ emissions.</p> \n<p>Natural gas is also a natural ally to renewables. Solar power and wind need a back-up because they are intermittent sources. Gas-fired power can keep the electricity flowing when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, in part because gas-fired power plants can be turned on and off quickly.</p> \n<p>Carbon capture and storage also must be part of a cleaner, more sustainable energy system.</p> \n<p>This technology captures CO₂ from power stations and other industrial plants and stores it safely underground. It will be critical to take CO₂ out of the power sector over the next 50 years. Carbon capture and storage can help us meet the demand for cleaner energy at a time when renewables are still being deployed on a relatively small scale.</p> \n<p>But the technology remains in the early stage of development. It needs major government financial support and strong mandates around the world to get off the ground.</p> \n<p>The third way we can begin to address our global energy challenge is to promote more effective, efficient city planning. This is a tremendous opportunity here in China as this country continues its journey towards becoming a more urban society.</p> \n<p>It’s simple, really: &nbsp;Cities with higher population density are more energy-efficient than sprawling cities. They encourage people to use public transport and drive less.</p> \n<p>Intelligent urban planning could transform the entire global transport system over the next 50 years. It can do so by providing an infrastructure for vehicles mainly powered by electricity, hydrogen and natural gas. But for all of these changes to happen, we will need far-sighted government policies and far more collaboration between governments and businesses.<br /> </p><h2>China: more energy, cleaner energy</h2><p>In China, we have already seen pragmatic energy policies being put in place to prepare for a future in which energy demand will soar. Since 1980, China’s population has grown by more than a third while its prosperity has soared. These trends have quadrupled domestic energy consumption.</p> \n<p>China has gone from being a coal and oil exporter to one of the largest importers of both resources. The 12<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan shows a will to diversify China’s energy sources with a view towards ensuring a cleaner, more sustainable energy system. The government has set out to increase the use of coal-based natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, as well as solar and wind.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of the government’s most significant steps is the promotion of natural gas. According to the International Energy Agency, this strong policy push boosted natural gas in the overall energy mix to 4% in 2009 from 2% in 2000. China now plans to double this share to 8% by 2015. Using more gas will help address China’s environmental challenges by reducing sulphur-oxide and nitrogen-oxide emissions, as well as particulates.</p> \n<p>The government has an initiative in which more than a dozen “model cities” have been chosen to transition to natural gas from coal and oil.&nbsp; One of these cities, Hangzhou, is reporting better air quality and soaring tourism revenue as a result.</p> \n<p>China is also backing carbon capture and storage technology to address the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. The Global CCS Institute reports China has the most pilot projects for this technology in the world. This is important as coal remains a dominant energy source. Coal accounted for 70% of China’s total energy consumption in 2009. This means a lot of CO₂ is being released.</p> \n<p>Internationally, China has committed to cooperative exchanges to address issues such as climate change and promote global energy security. Last year, a white paper from the Office of the State Council expressed the desire to see countries engage in mutually beneficial cooperation in international energy exploration. <br /> </p><h2>Partnering with China</h2><p>China already is working with global energy companies to access its abundant natural gas resources. Shell and China’s national oil companies have several successful partnerships that are helping to achieve the government’s objectives.</p> \n<p>Shell has always been a company built on international relationships and technology. Today, mutually beneficial relationships with state-owned national oil companies are at the heart of the energy industry. They are driving progress and unlocking resources.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we are developing strong relationships with all of China’s national oil companies. Our ongoing cooperation with China is underpinned by four strategic priorities:</p> \n<p>First is developing China’s tight and shale gas resources to meet rising demand with cleaner fuels.</p> \n<p>According to the IEA, China has technically recoverable shale gas reserves of 25 trillion cubic metres. In 2009, Shell and PetroChina agreed to explore for shale gas in the Fushun block. We developed this relationship further last year when we signed a shale gas Production Sharing Contract for this project. It was a milestone for our partnership and the industry.</p> \n<p>Our second priority is helping Chinese enterprises grow overseas.</p> \n<p>One example is Gabon in West Africa, where Shell has two offshore exploration blocks. Last year, CNOOC acquired a 25% interest in these blocks, giving it an opportunity to work with us on a major exploration project outside China.</p> \n<p>Our third area of shared focus is international co-operation to import energy to China.</p> \n<p>In 2010, Shell and CNPC jointly bought Arrow Energy in Australia, a company that develops gas trapped in coal seams, then processes and sells it. While Arrow continues to supply gas and power in its domestic market, it is also working to turn coal-seam gas into liquefied natural gas which can be exported by ship to China and other international markets.</p> \n<p>Our fourth strategic priority is co-operation on research, development and technology.</p> \n<p>For example, last year Shell signed two joint agreements with the research arm of CNPC for cooperative research on unconventional gas exploration and development, and enhanced oil recovery.</p> \n<p>And in the next few months, we will launch a China Energy Study, a two-year project jointly carried out by Shell and the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The study will provide valuable insights into China’s energy developments.</p> \n<p>Shell also is proud to be one of the partners involved in the China Development Research Foundation’s energy and environment initiative. This initiative has proposed a series of policy recommendations to help China reach its long-term energy goals.</p> \n<p>In the years to come, we look forward to more close partnerships with China’s national oil companies. These partnerships show how business and government can collaborate to deliver a cleaner, more secure energy system.</p> \n<p>I am convinced partnerships will play a growing role in helping China make the most of its extensive resources, especially its natural gas, for the benefit of its people, its economy and its environment.</p><h2>An incredible challenge</h2><p>In conclusion, the world faces an incredible challenge to meet our future energy demand, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and manage the stresses on our water and food resources.</p> \n<p>Governments and industry can take far-sighted actions now that will reap benefits for decades to come. These actions include taking advantage of the world’s abundant natural gas resources, supporting carbon capture and storage technology, and focusing on smarter urban planning.</p> \n<p>The Chinese government is to be commended for already taking steps to address these energy challenges, steps that will lead to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.</p> \n<p>Finally, I invite you to review the latest report of Shell’s scenarios team. I hope it will contribute to addressing our global energy challenge and help to strengthen the coalition between business and government towards building a more resilient energy future.</p> \n<p>At Shell, we remain committed to working with your government and national oil companies to realise China’s ambitious energy objectives.</p>",

          "summary": "<p>Royal Dutch Shell (“Shell”) is engaged in a multi-year drilling programme to explore for new oil & gas resources in high-potential blocks in offshore Alaska. Important progress has been made with this programme, with two drill ships, more than twenty support vessels, an approved capping stack, and other redundant oil spill response equipment already in position. Shell continues to demonstrate the strength and extent of its Arctic preparations.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>Over the last several days, Shell has successfully completed a series of tests of the first-ever Arctic Containment System. However, during a final test, the containment dome aboard the Arctic Challenger barge was damaged. It is clear that some days will be required to repair and fully assess dome readiness. We are disappointed that the dome has not yet met our stringent acceptance standards; but, as we have said all along, we will not conduct any operation until we are satisfied that we are fully prepared to do it safely. <br /><br />The time required to repair the dome, along with steps we have taken to protect local whaling operations and to ensure the safety of operations from ice floe movement, have led us to revise our plans for the 2012-2013 exploration program. In order to lay a strong foundation for operations in 2013, we will forgo drilling into hydrocarbon zones this year. Instead, we will begin as many wells, known as ‘top holes,’ as time remaining in this season allows. The top portion of the wells drilled in the days and weeks ahead will be safely capped and temporarily abandoned this year, in accordance with regulatory requirements. We look forward to the final receipt of our drilling permits for the multi-year exploration program upon the successful testing and deployment of the Arctic Containment System.<br /><br />These capabilities have, most recently, been evident in Shell’s ice management operations as it successfully moved one of its drill ships and support vessels safely out of the path of approaching sea ice. That drill ship, the Noble Discoverer, is expected to resume its position and drilling operations over the ‘Burger A’ prospect in the days ahead. <br /><br />Also, in the coming days, Shell is expected to begin exploratory drilling in the Beaufort Sea. These operations will follow the conclusion of the fall whale hunt and the anticipated receipt of a top hole drilling permit. <br /><br />We have tested and assembled drill ships and support vessels, trained personnel, and acquired numerous final approved plans and permits. This exploration program remains critically important to America’s energy needs, to the economy and jobs in Alaska, and to Shell.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong><br />International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550 <br /><br /><strong>Shell Investor Relations</strong><br />Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States - Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong><br />Cautionary note </strong><br />The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

The Quest project will be built on behalf of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project joint venture owners (Shell, Chevron and Marathon Oil*) and with support from the Governments of Canada and Alberta.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>CCS is critical to meeting the huge projected increase in global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, explained Peter Voser, Chief Executive Officer of Royal Dutch Shell plc. “If you want to achieve climate change goals, <a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg1/upstream0/oil-sands/quest/ccs.html\" class=\"shell\">CCS has to be part of the solution</a>. We are helping to advance CCS technology on a number of fronts around the world, but Quest will be our flagship project.”</p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sqkXYKRFkFc?rel=0\"></iframe><p>Alberta’s oil sands are a secure, reliable source of energy and an economic engine which drives employment, training and business development across Canada and beyond.&nbsp; “We will need all sources of energy to meet world demand in the coming decades,” Voser noted.&nbsp; “Lower CO<sub>2</sub> energy sources will grow, but even by 2050 at least 65 per cent of our energy will still come from fossil fuels.&nbsp; So CCS will be important to manage climate impacts.”</p> \n<p>The Athabasca Oil Sands project produces bitumen, which is piped to Shell’s Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton, Alberta.&nbsp; From late 2015, Quest will capture and store deep underground more than one million tonnes a year of CO<sub>2</sub> produced in bitumen processing.&nbsp; Quest will reduce direct emissions from the Scotford Upgrader by up to 35 per cent – the equivalent of taking 175,000 North American cars off the road annually.</p> \n<p>“Quest is another example of how we are using technology and innovation to improve the environmental performance of our oil sands operations,” said Shell Executive Vice President of Heavy Oil, John Abbott. “The opportunity Quest provides to reduce emissions from our upgrading activities is an important achievement in itself, but the project’s technical and strategic value reaches beyond the emissions it will capture.”</p> \n<p>“Quest is important because it is a fully integrated project that will demonstrate existing capture, transportation, injection and storage <a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg1/upstream0/oil-sands/quest/technology.html\" class=\"shell\">technologies</a> working together for the safe and permanent storage of CO<sub>2</sub>. The knowledge it provides will help to enable much wider and more cost-effective application of CCS through the energy industry and other sectors in years to come.”</p> \n<p>Both the Canadian federal and Albertan provincial governments have identified CCS as an important technology in their strategies to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The Alberta government will invest $745 million in Quest from a $2-billion fund to support CCS, while the Government of Canada will invest $120 million through its Clean Energy Fund.</p> \n<p>“We will continue to invest in innovative clean energy technologies such as the Shell Quest project to help support high-quality jobs and responsible development of Canada’s energy resources,” said the Honourable Joe Oliver, Minister of Natural Resources. “Carbon capture and storage has the potential to help us balance our need for energy with our need to protect the environment.”</p> \n<p>“Today’s announcement reaffirms Alberta’s position as a global leader in carbon capture and storage,” said Energy Minister Ken Hughes. “Technologies like CCS will play an instrumental role in helping to lower greenhouse gas intensity from the oil sands and demonstrate to the world Alberta’s commitment to responsible energy development.”</p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fnhz0IUdWg?rel=0\"></iframe><p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls CCS “a crucial part of worldwide efforts to limit global warming” and estimates that it could deliver about one-fifth of necessary worldwide reductions in greenhouse gases by 2050.&nbsp; Shell is also working with governments and experts to help the development of CCS in other countries, including projects in Norway and Australia.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Quest is the world’s first commercial-scale CCS project to tackle carbon emissions in the oil sands, and the first CCS project in which Shell will hold majority ownership and act as designer, builder and operator.&nbsp; It will also form the core of Shell’s CCS research programme and help develop Shell’s CO<sub>2</sub> capture technology.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Shell has received the necessary <a standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" href=\"http://www.shell.ca/en/aboutshell/our-business-tpkg1/upstream0/oil-sands/quest/consultation.html\" class=\"shell\">federal and provincial regulatory approvals </a>for Quest.&nbsp; Construction has begun and will employ an average of about 400 skilled trades workers over roughly 30 months, peaking at about 700.</p><p><sup><em>* The Athabasca Oil Sands Project, with 255,000 barrels per day of mining and upgrading capacity, is a joint venture among Shell Canada Energy (60 per cent), Chevron Canada Limited (20 per cent) and Marathon Oil Canada Corporation (20 per cent).</em></sup></p> \n<p><sup><br /></sup></p><h2>More about Quest</h2><p>The Quest CCS project will capture more than one million tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> from the Scotford Upgrader located near Edmonton, Alberta and transport it up by an 80 km underground pipeline to a storage site north of the Scotford site. Here, it will inject it more than two kilometres underground into a porous rock formation called the Basal Cambrian Sands (BCS), which is located beneath layers of impermeable rock. Sophisticated monitoring technologies will ensure the CO<sub>2</sub> is permanently stored. In 2011, Quest received the world’s first certificate of fitness for its storage development plan from Det Norske Veritas (DNV), an international risk management firm.&nbsp;DNV assembled a panel of seven <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmjTPzvkJo\" standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" target=\"_blank\">CCS experts from academia and research institutions</a> to perform the review over a two-week period.</p> \n<p>To improve efficiency, up to 50 per cent of project work will be done offsite at a construction yard yet to be selected. Shell will use <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9jwFm9Pbk\" standard_icon=\"inactive_icon\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" target=\"_blank\">third-party construction facilities</a> in Edmonton, helping the continuing development of key construction capacity in the province.

Today Shell produces oil and gas from land and swamps in the Niger Delta and from deep-water reserves some 120 km off the coast of Nigeria. In 2012, the total production from Shell-run operations averaged 949,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Shell also has an interest in Nigeria’s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant at Bonny, which exports gas to different parts of the world.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s07.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/operating-environment.pdf\">The Operating Environment</a></li></ul><p>The Niger Delta continues to be a challenging place to operate for many reasons. There is a fundamental lack of basic infrastructure in many areas, with poverty, lack of employment opportunities, widespread criminality and other factors all contributing to the social and economic crisis in the region. Criminality has expressed itself in many forms over the years – attacks on facilities, kidnapping, militancy and, most worrisome in recent years, crude oil theft and illegal refining. In 2012, there were over 80 reported incidents of crude oil theft from the facilities of the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), several accompanied by vandalism, spills and fire.<br /> </p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s05.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/unep.pdf\">The UNEP report</a></li></ul><p>SPDC supports the government—led Ogoni reconciliation process. On the request of the government, SPDC and its joint venture partners financed the UNEP report and provided data as required. The report highlighted significant environmental impacts from oil pollution in parts of Ogoniland and called on government, industry and communities to take action to put an end to all forms of oil contamination (including crude oil theft and illegal refining) and begin a comprehensive clean up. SPDC has welcomed the UNEP report and is advocating more concerted efforts by all stakeholders in the hopes that the report will drive real change in Ogoniland and the wider Niger Delta.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/nigerian-content.pdf\">Nigeria Content</a></li></ul><p>Shell Companies in Nigeria awarded 96% of their total number of contracts to Nigerian companies (total value of $2.4 billion) in 2012, an increase of $1 billion above the 2011 figure. These contracts represent 64% of the total spend on contracts during the year. In recognition of the fact that lack of access to capital is a key blocker to the growth of Nigerian companies, SPDC launched a $5 billion Contractor Support Fund Scheme with five (5) leading Nigerian banks. This scheme provides companies with SCiN contracts affordable access to credit to enable them execute their contracts successfully.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/community-content.pdf\">Community Content</a></li></ul><p>In 2012 the Shell Kobo Fund, a Community Content initiative launched in 2011 enabled small Niger Delta contractors to access loans needed to finance the supply of goods/services to SPDC. This made a huge impact on the capability of these contractors to finance contracts awarded to them by SPDC. In recognition of the impact of this scheme, SPDC was awarded the Social Enterprise Report and Awards (SERAs) recognition for “Wealth and Income Generation (Poverty Reduction)” in 2012. The Shell Kobo Fund is a four billion Naira ($27 million) community contractor-financing scheme put in place by SPDC in collaboration with three top Nigerian Banks — First Bank of Nigeria Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc and Zenith Bank Plc.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/domestic-gas.pdf\">Domestic Gas</a></li></ul><p>SPDC is at the forefront of gas development and utilization in Nigeria, having pioneered the production and delivery of gas to consumers for over 40 years.&nbsp; In the 1960s SPDC JV began supplying gas to industries in Trans-Amadi in Port Harcourt, Aba territories, and to power plants at Afam in Rivers State in the Niger Delta. For most of that time until about 1998, SPDC JV was the sole supplier of gas in the country. After 1998, SPDC remained the single largest supplier at about 70% of the country’s domestic gas supply (with a high percentage utilised for power generation) until the recent portfolio optimization when it divested some of its assets. These divestments are part of SPDC’s strategy of refocusing its onshore interests in Nigeria and supporting the Federal Government’s aim of developing indigenous Nigerian companies in the country’s upstream sector.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/improving-lives.pdf\">Improving Lives in the Niger Delta</a></li></ul><p>Shell operations in Nigeria generate billions of dollars in revenue in terms of taxes, duties, royalties, fees and the like, for the government. The joint venture operated by The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) has contributed about $42billion to the government in the past five years (2008–2012). Apart from this, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), which manages our offshore business in deep water, has paid nearly $6 billion in taxes and royalties over the same period. As a statutory obligation, Shell-operated ventures also contributed over $178.3 million to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) (Shell share $68.2 million).</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/shell-nigeria-gas.pdf\">Shell Nigeria Gas</a></li></ul><p>SNG currently operates in the industrial clusters of Agbara, Ota, Igbessa and Aba, as well as in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, to supply natural gas used as fuel for various industrial processes and power generation. Since inception, SNG has helped to drive economic growth by enabling the industries currently served on its network to use natural gas, a cleaner substitute for diesel and other liquid fuels. Natural gas is abundantly available in Nigeria at an affordable price in comparison to other fuels that industries use. It is also the cleanest of all the fossil fuels and helps reduce the emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Natural gas supplied by SNG through its network has resulted in significant savings to its customers and enabled many of them to expand their production lines. By the end of 2012, SNG distributed an average of about 30 million standard cubic feet a day of natural gas produced from the Niger Delta to industries and factories in its areas of operation. Many multinational and local companies, for example, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria Plc, Unilever Plc and Nestle Nigeria Plc are among the customers that are currently being supplied.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s02.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/gas-flaring.pdf\">Gas Flaring</a></li></ul><p>In many oil fields gas is produced with crude oil when it is brought to the surface. This is particularly true in the Niger Delta where much of the oil has a high proportion of this ‘associated’ gas. When The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) first built many of its production facilities in the 1950s, there was little demand or market for gas in many parts of the world, including Nigeria. So, associated gas (AG) was usually burned off safely – a process called flaring. This remained an accepted industry practice as SPDC established a major oil operation across the Niger Delta.<br /> </p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s08.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/gmou.pdf\">Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU)</a></li></ul><p>Over the years, SPDC has improved on how it engages with local communities to deliver these projects. In 2006, it introduced a new way of working with communities called the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU). The GMoUs represent an important shift in approach, placing emphasis on more transparent and accountable processes, regular communication with the grassroots, sustainability and conflict prevention. By the end of 2012, SPDC had signed agreements with 33 GMoU clusters, covering 349 communities, about 35% of the local communities around our business operations in the delta. In 2012, a total of 723 projects were successfully completed through GMoUs (including specific project-GMoUs). To date, the cumulative total funding for GMoU projects and programmes is over $117 million (with over $30 million in 2012 alone). Nine of the 33 Cluster Development Boards (CDB) have grown to become registered foundations now receiving third party funding.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s05.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/deepwater.pdf\">Deep Water</a></li></ul><p>In November 2005, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo) began to produce oil and gas at Bonga, 120 km offshore Nigeria in the Gulf of Guinea. The project, the country’s first in deepwater, increased Nigeria’s oil capacity by 10%. First discovered in 1995, Bonga lies in water 1,000 plus metres deep across an area of 60 square km. It has the capacity to produce more than 200,000 barrels of oil a day and 150 million standard cubic feet of gas a day. By the end of December 2012, Bonga had produced about 450 million barrels of oil.<br /> </p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/environmental-performance.pdf\">Environmental Performance - Oil Spills</a></li></ul><p>The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) is committed to cleaning up all spills from its facilities as fast as possible regardless of cause. Majority of the spills in the Niger Delta are the result of third party interference, mainly sabotage, theft of equipment or leaks caused by crude oil thieves drilling into pipelines or opening up wellheads to steal oil. On average, third party interference accounts for around 73% of all oil spill incidents and around 76% of all oil volume spilled from SPDC facilities in the delta over the last five years (2008-2012). Unfortunately, the rest of the volume is as a result of operational spills. Any spill is a serious concern and SPDC staff and contractors are working hard to eliminate operational spill incidents.<br /> </p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s08.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/country/nga/downloads/pdf/2013bnotes/economic-contribution.pdf\">Economic Contribution</a></li></ul><p>The largest economic contribution by Shell Companies in Nigeria is through the taxes and royalties we pay, the government’s participation in our operations and the energy we produce. Nigeria depends on the oil and gas industry for approximately 95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of government revenue. It also contributes to developing the country’s human capital and local contracting capacity in related areas. The joint venture operated by The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) has contributed about $42billion to the government in the past five years (2008– 2012). The Federal Government receives about 95% of the revenue after costs from the SPDC operated joint venture. Similarly, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company of Nigeria Limited (SNEPCo), which operates in the offshore deep water, has contributed in excess of $25billion to the government in the last five years.</p>",

          "maintext": "<p><i>Technology and innovation have always played a key role in moving the energy industry forward. In this speech to the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Beijing, Peter Voser discusses how technology and innovation are helping to meet the world’s future energy challenge today.&nbsp; He also explains the significant influence China will play, and how partnerships and collaboration will be critical in easing the transition to a more sustainable energy future.<br /> </i></p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/240-wide/peter-voser.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Voser\"/><h2>The role of technology, innovation and partnership in meeting global energy demand</h2><p>When I first read the title of today’s session, “Challenging Technology &amp; Economic Limits to Meet the Global Energy Demand”, I thought it sounded a bit pessimistic. Indeed, there are limits and challenges to meeting the world’s future energy needs.</p> \n<p>But I am convinced there is also reason for optimism, that if we make smart and pragmatic choices today, the world’s energy future can be bright.</p> \n<p>To get there, to meet surging demand and transform our energy system to one that is cleaner and more sustainable, will require a new level of collaboration among business partners and an increased focus on new technology.</p><h2>Technology’s role</h2><p>Technology and innovation have always played a critical role in our industry.&nbsp; And it’s clear their role is even more significant today. Many successful new technologies in our business work because they make exploration, extraction or production of our energy resources more affordable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They lower those “economic limits”. In fact, new technologies and innovation are already providing us with the tools to meet our energy challenges. I’d like to note a few examples from around the world, specifically, the United States, Korea and Qatar.</p> \n<p>As you know, in the United States improved technology in hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling has created what is often referred to as the “shale revolution”. It is the most significant energy development in decades.</p> \n<p>The same technology holds the promise of unlocking the huge potential of China’s shale and tight gas resources. Some experts estimate China’s unconventional gas resources could be 50 percent larger than those in the United States, though much work remains to assess and confirm those resources.</p> \n<p>Let’s turn now to South Korea. In shipyard there, work is under way on what we expect to be the first vessel to process, store and transfer liquefied natural gas at sea. It will be the largest floating offshore facility in the world.</p> \n<p>This massive display of technological know-how will allow us to tap gas fields that were previously considered too far offshore or too small to be economically developed in the traditional way. It will eliminate the need to devote land and pipelines to process LNG onshore.</p> \n<p>Our first floating LNG facility will develop the Prelude gas field off Australia’s northwest coast. We hope to build more FLNG vessels to tap other offshore fields, including those in Asian waters, which stands to benefit China.</p> \n<p>On the other side of the world, on the desert sands of Qatar, Shell is converting natural gas into liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks at our massive Pearl gas-to-liquids plant. This $20-billion investment is the culmination of more than three decades of research and refinement to perfect this technology.&nbsp; It resulted in about 3,500 patents.</p> \n<p>Each of these achievements resulted from developing technology to overcome obstacles, then drawing upon our operational expertise to make it work. It’s something we at Shell do well; it’s what we bring to the table.</p> \n<p>Of our more than 90,000 employees worldwide in 80-plus countries, about half work day in and day out with technology. These are the scientists, engineers and technicians who make our global operation work, safely and efficiently.</p> \n<p>Adapting this kind of technology to meet China’s specific needs is critical if the world is to meet its future energy challenge. China’s energy consumption could double by 2030 if current economic growth trends continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To meet that demand and that of a growing world outside China, we need to pursue new resources, resources that are going to be more difficult to reach. That means oil fields in deep water or in remote locations like the Arctic. It means unconventional gas and oil trapped in tight rock formations. It means getting the methane trapped in massive coal beds deep underground.</p> \n<p>Our strategy involves developing the right concepts for China’s energy projects by integrating our in-house technology and operational skills with that of our partners.</p> \n<p>For example, the industry traditionally has used large, complex, multi-function rigs to tap into deposits of unconventional gas though hundreds of wells, each drilled individually. But in partnership with CNPC, we have developed a new process that uses smaller, mobile rigs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The system promises greater efficiency, lower costs, lower emissions, less noise and requires less space. And each rig will operate with fewer people than conventional rigs. This technology is in trials in the Netherlands and the United States. Its lower operating cost should make viable many projects that previously were considered too costly.</p> \n<p>The partnership has already signed its first contract to provide well services with this technology to Arrow Energy, a Shell-CNPC joint venture in Australia. And there are potentially several such projects inside China as well.</p> \n<p>There are many examples of how Shell’s technological and operational expertise is being utilized on projects in partnership with China’s national oil companies. We are proud of how these strong, mutually beneficial relationships have developed.</p><h2>Partnerships and collaboration</h2><p>I am convinced that strong partnerships will be increasingly critical to ease the transition to a new energy future. As business people, we are accustomed to serving our customers through effective commercial collaboration that drives innovation, efficiency and profits.</p> \n<p>What we need to do better – and quickly – is improve our collaboration with other companies, with governments and civil society in every region around the globe. No one company can go it alone anymore; the scale of the energy challenge is too big.</p> \n<p>We also need far more coordination and collaboration between government policymakers, business, academia and other groups than we are seeing today.</p> \n<p>Shell has a long tradition of partnering and collaborating with other independent oil companies and with national oil companies, including those here in China. And increasingly we are partnering with leading companies in other industries, including IT, aerospace, and even video rendering, to create advanced technology solutions.</p> \n<p>Here in China, we recently signed two joint agreements with CNPC’s research institute to investigate aspects of unconventional gas development and enhanced oil recovery. We also have several other research projects with major Chinese universities and academies.<b></b></p> \n<p>And we have set up a PhD scholarship program with the China University of Petroleum, which we see as a leading training ground for scientists and engineers.</p> \n<p>Shell is also proud to be one of the partners involved in the China Development Research Foundation’s energy and environment initiative. The initiative has proposed a series of policy recommendations to help China reach its long-term energy goals.</p> \n<p>From our experience, successful partnerships result when both sides are clear on what they want to achieve, when their needs are taken into account in a balanced way, and when they are able to adapt to changing circumstances over time.</p> \n<p>Partnerships and collaboration will play a growing role in helping China make the most of its resources for the benefit of its people, its economy and its natural environment. Such collaboration increasingly will include projects outside China, as well.</p><h2>Partnering Outside China</h2><p>For example, last year CNOOC acquired a 25% interest in two Shell offshore exploration blocks in the West African nation of Gabon. This will give CNOOC an opportunity to work with us on a major exploration project outside China. It is in addition to the joint deepwater exploration that Shell and CNOOC are planning in the South China Sea.</p> \n<p>In Canada, we have joined with PetroChina and other partners to study the feasibility of building and operating a liquefied natural gas export terminal in British Columbia. Canada is the world’s second-largest natural gas exporter. Recent discoveries of shale gas have expanded its reserves.</p> \n<p>Traditionally, most Canadian gas went to the United States. But that country is now awash in natural gas thanks to the shale revolution. As a result, Canada is looking for new export markets.</p> \n<p>For China, natural gas offers a much cleaner-burning alternative to coal for power generation – but also for residential heating and industrial processes.</p> \n<p>As I’ve already mentioned, we see tremendous potential for unconventional gas in China.&nbsp; But much of it remains in the early stages of exploration and appraisal. Pipeline and LNG imports will help keep China’s gas supplies secure as it explores its own resources. Some of that LNG could be imported from Canada.</p> \n<p>Shell already imports about 2 million tonnes of LNG a year into China, and that figure will rise.</p> \n<p>Shell and its Chinese partners are working on additional projects here in China, including a proposed integrated refinery in Zhejiang province. And we believe there is room for even more.</p> \n<p>Shell’s technical leadership in areas ranging from deepwater exploration and production to enhanced oil recovery could also help China achieve its energy goals. Technology also will play a role in helping the world address climate change.</p> \n<p>Carbon capture and storage technology is the best current example, and the most practical. But it needs government support to get off the ground.</p> \n<p>China’s leadership has wisely recognized the need for this technology to develop, by supporting numerous pilot projects. This is important, as coal remains the dominant energy source here and carbon capture could play a major role in reducing CO₂ from coal plants and other sources.</p> \n<p>As I said, I am optimistic about the role technology will play in the decades ahead in helping us meet our future energy challenge. But its benefits will come only from a long-term commitment to research and to finding ways to apply that research in the field.</p> \n<p>The pace of growth and scale of China’s energy system ensures this nation will have a tremendous influence on how the world addresses this challenge. Indeed, China has a unique opportunity to chart a new path to a more sustainable energy system that supports economic prosperity, and reflects the new reality in which we live.</p> \n<p>We at Shell are excited about playing a role in helping China determine its future energy path, through partnerships based on trust, respect, experience, technology and innovation.</p>",

          "summary": "<p>Forty years ago, in 1972, work began on what many people regard as the first Shell Scenarios document, published the following year, though the roots of this work lie even further in the past. Since then, scenario planning has been at the heart of Shell’s business, developing senior leadership understanding of critical factors in the business environment and the possible directions which economic, geopolitical and social systems could take, decades into the future.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>In the last four decades, Shell Scenario planners have highlighted many key world trends and discontinuities, ensuring that Shell as a business has been able to plan for several eventualities and maintain business continuity through even the most turbulent times. For example, the original Scenarios helped Shell’s leaders to prepare for the possibility of an oil price shock – a prescient move given the Yom Kippur war, which broke out in October 1973.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Bentham, Shell’s Vice President, Global Business Environment, said: “Ever since our Scenarios programme began forty years ago, we have been creating and applying many different scenarios to anticipate global and local economic, social and political changes and how they could affect our business.</p> \n<p>“Looking to the future, our scenario planners are now developing a new angle to their work, which recognises the even more complex nature of the modern world. It will provide clarity and insights by zooming in on specific details, then zooming out to give a broader perspective.”</p> \n<p>The next iteration of the Shell Scenarios, to be published in early 2013, will focus on areas that are fundamental to the development of energy and environmental systems in the 21st century. These include the connection between energy, water and food systems and the impact of growing global urbanisation.</p> \n<p>To mark this major anniversary, we are publishing ‘40 Years of Shell Scenarios’, a reminder of our Scenarios work over many years with illustrations of how scenario planning has had a positive impact on the world in a variety of areas.</p> \n<p>Speaking ahead of a panel discussion to coincide with the booklet’s launch today, Simon Henry, Shell’s Chief Financial Officer, said: “Shell has a long and distinguished history of scenario planning, and the intelligence and innovation that our Scenarios teams have contributed over many decades has proved hugely beneficial to our business. By providing unique insights and detailed analysis into the ever-changing global landscape, and projecting forward possible outcomes, the Scenarios team helps Shell’s senior leadership make better informed decisions about our current and future operations.”</p> \n<p>The Shell Scenarios methodology has been adapted by many different organisations and individuals worldwide to help them in their work.</p> \n<p>Adam Kahane, Associate Fellow at the Sa&iuml;d Business School, Oxford University said: “The Shell methodology has been one of the main building blocks for the ‘transformative scenario planning’ work that my colleagues and I have been engaged in for the past twenty years. The spirit of Shell’s scenario practice – logical and rigorous, creative and open – has guided us throughout.”</p> \n<p>Peter Ho, Senior Advisor for the Centre of Strategic Futures, a think-tank of the Singapore Government, said: “The Singapore Government started using scenario planning in 1991.&nbsp; Shell strongly supported this effort. Today, scenario planning is embedded in the Government’s annual strategic planning cycle.”</p> \n<p>Philip Bobbit, Herbert Wechsler Professor of Jurisprudence at Columbia University and Director of Columbia Law School’s Center on National Security, said: “One thing that’s always impressed me about the Shell people was that they did a whole new set of scenarios every five years, sometimes even less. Yet if you look at all their old scenarios, they are almost uncanny in showing how the world would change. Scenario planning is perhaps the most important analytical tool we have and Shell has been the most important innovator in that process.”</p> \n<p>Amory Levins, Chairman and Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute, said: “Shell Scenarios are a unique resource for all of us who think about the energy future. Shell is the most far-sighted and strategic of the majors, largely because the Scenarios informed the thinking of Shell leadership and many others in the energy ecosystem. Without this exercise, people would have a much shorter and dimmer view of the future than they need to in a very long lead time business.”</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p>Shell International Media Relations&nbsp;<br />+44 (0) 20 7934 5550</p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p>For more information about Shell Scenarios, and to download ’40 Years of Shell Scenarios’, visit <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/40-years.html\" class=\"shell\">www.shell.com/scenarios</a>.</p> \n<p>Royal Dutch Shell plc is incorporated in England and Wales, has its headquarters in The Hague and is listed on the London, Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges.

          "summary": "<p>Shell Lubricants (“Shell”) has topped the list of the world’s leading lubricants suppliers for the fifth year running, according to new research into the global lubricants market. The research, conducted by Kline & Company* (“Kline”), gives Shell more than 13% of the market by volume in 2010 and a two per cent lead over its nearest competitor.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>Mark Gainsborough, Shell’s Head of Lubricants, said: “Five years at the top is a remarkable achievement. It shows that our consistent strategy of focusing on leading technology and strong customer relationships has served us well. Shell has more than 200 research and development staff working in lubricants technology, more than 300 front line technical advisers and over 1000 sales professionals, all tasked with providing competitive solutions for our customers. Without question, their success is central to our continued growth and brand leadership.”<br /><br />As well as maintaining its leadership position in 2010 on an overall volume basis, Shell also leads in the branded lubricants category. Mark Gainsborough said Shell’s distinctive approach to selling lubricants through distributors was paying dividends: “In 2010 we more than doubled average distributor volumes compared to 2009. The exceptional support we give to our distributors, coupled with strong staff development, is very difficult for our competitors to copy.”<br /><br />Global demand for lubricants as a whole grew by around 6% over 2009 – indicating a slight recovery from recession. According to Kline, the Asia-Pacific region continued to show the most robust volume growth in 2010, benefiting from the shift in automotive production. Shell achieved strong volume growth in China, maintaining its lead as the top international supplier.<br /><br />The US was the largest single market in terms of lubricant volume demand – accounting for 23% of global consumption in 2010 (down from 25% in 2009). Shell maintained its leadership position in the US lubricants market with more than 11% share by volume.<br /><br />Looking ahead, Kline forecast slow growth for the market as a whole but identified opportunities at country and product level. The strongest growth is predicted to come from the BRIC countries plus South Korea, with China as “the growth engine” of the industry.<br /><br />Demand for lubricants in China is projected to grow by 5% between 2010 and 2020. Over the same period, Kline predicts that lubricant demand in India will grow at between 3% and 5%.<br />The annual research study also highlighted increasing demand for synthetic lubricants which help end users improve energy efficiency and prolong equipment life.<br /><br />Mark Gainsborough said: “Shell is well positioned to make the most of growth opportunities and sustain our market leadership position. Last month we reached a significant milestone when the first shipment of base oil left the Pearl GTL plant in Qatar. At full capacity this plant will provide one of the world’s largest sources of high quality base oil, giving us unrivalled access to Group III base oil for use in our premium and synthetic lubricants.<br /><br />“In Russia we will shortly open our Torzhok blending plant - the first to be built by an international oil company in that country. The plant is set to be one of the largest in the Shell network worldwide, enabling us to grow faster and compete on an equal footing with local lubricants suppliers.<br /><br />“And in China we recently opened a state-of-the-art technical services centre in Zhuhai. The centre will provide comprehensive lubricating solutions to customers in the automobile, shipping and power industries.”</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell International Media Relations<br /></strong>London Office +44 (0) 20 7934 7780<br /><br /><strong>Shell Commercial Communications<br /></strong>+44 (0) 20 7934 2253<br /><br /><strong>Kline &amp; Company, Energy VP - Geeta Agashe (office)<br /></strong>+1 973 435 3484</p><p><em>*Kline &amp; Company is a worldwide consulting and research firm.

The Cardamom project is expected to produce 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) a day at peak production and more than 140 million boe over its lifetime.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>“Technological advances in seismic imaging and drilling have allowed us to both discover and access this new field,” said Marvin Odum, Shell Upstream Americas Director. “This is another sizeable deep-water investment by Shell that strengthens energy supplies to the USA. It will also secure employment for more offshore workers.”</p> \n<p>Shell’s rigorous global safety standards underpin our approach to deep-water exploration and production. Our exploration plan for Cardamom (Shell interest 100%) was the first to receive approval since the lifting of the US government moratorium on drilling in the GoM. As a result of today’s final investment decision, Shell will move ahead with further development drilling and installing undersea equipment.</p> \n<p>Shell discovered the Cardamom reservoir in 2010 using advanced seismic technology that was able to produce improved images versus traditional seismic methods. The discovery was confirmed by drilling a well from Shell’s Auger platform that broke records for length and depth. The exploration wells were drilled more than 6.4 kilometres (four miles) below the seabed.</p> \n<p>Production from Cardamom will flow through the Auger platform, minimising the offshore footprint by using existing infrastructure.</p> \n<p>The development of the Cardamom field is the latest step in Shell’s deep-water energy production activities in the GoM. Perdido, the world’s deepest offshore production facility, came on-stream in 2010. Later that year Shell announced the decision to go ahead with a second platform in our Mars B field in the GoM.</p> \n<p>Today’s final investment decision for Cardamom is in line with Shell’s continued drive to increase global oil and gas production. The rapid progress from discovery of the reservoir to the launch of development plans represents Shell’s ability to move forward with projects of major value.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Media Relations <br /></strong>International, UK, European Press - David Williams: +31 70 377 3600<br />United States - Bill Tanner:&nbsp;&nbsp;+1 713 241 7228</p> \n<p><br /><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br /></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States&nbsp;- Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><ul> \n <li> Cardamom is 100% Shell owned and operated. </li> \n <li> The Cardamom discovery is located in Garden Banks Block 427, approximately 362 kilometres (225 miles) south-west of New Orleans, Louisiana, in water more than 800 metres (2,720 feet) deep. </li> \n <li> The completed subsea system will include five well expandable manifolds, a dual 20-centimetre (8-inch) flowline, and eight well umbilicals.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> \n <li> Modifications to the Auger platform will include additional subsea receiving equipment, a new production train and weight mitigation, which is expected to significantly increase the Cardamom liquid handling, cooling and production capacities. </li> \n <li> The Cardamom discovery was a result of advances in seismic imaging and extended reach drilling.&nbsp; The potential of Cardamom was first recognised early in the Auger development, but could not be fully assessed due to a layer of salt nearby which affected the quality of traditional seismic images.&nbsp; Advances in seismic imaging helped achieve significant improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> \n <li> The Cardamom discovery well was drilled from Auger and features a measured depth of 9,642 metres (31,634 feet), a reach of more than 4,570 metres (15,000 feet), and a vertical depth greater than 7,620 metres (25,000 feet). </li> \n <li> The first Cardamom exploration well has been producing directly from the Auger platform since December, 2010.&nbsp; </li> \n <li> Since initial development in 1994, the Auger field has produced more than 300 million barrels of oil equivalent. </li> \n</ul><img src=\"http://s08.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/media/imgs/544-wide/cardamom-seismic.gif\" alt=\"The Cardamom field is located 6.4kms (4 miles) below the seafloor the other side of a salt column from the main Auger fields.\"/><p><br /><strong>Cautionary note<br /></strong>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

          "summary": "<p>Shell and Cosan today launched a multi-billion dollar joint venture that will become a leading producer of the low-carbon biofuel, ethanol made from sugar cane. Named Raízen, this major retail and commercial fuels company will operate in Brazil, one of the world's fastest-growing markets.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>In one of the biggest biofuels deals to date, Shell is combining its extensive retail experience, global network and research in advanced biofuels with Cosan's technical knowledge of producing biofuels on a large scale. Ra&iacute;zen will produce and sell over 2 billion litres a year of the lowest-carbon biofuel commercially available - ethanol made from Brazilian sugar cane.</p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SxH22GZAPtg?rel=0\"></iframe><p>Shell is already one of the largest distributors of sustainable biofuels: now it is moving for the first time into production. The deal with Cosan is a major development in Shell's strategy of investing for selective growth in its fuels business.</p> \n<p>Ra&iacute;zen will distribute biofuels and over 20 billion litres of other industrial and transport fuels annually through a combined network of nearly 4,500 Shell-branded service stations. In Brazil it becomes the third largest fuels company. Plans would extend the company's reach in future years to export more ethanol to other key markets.</p> \n<p>Low-carbon biofuels will be the most practical and commercially realistic way to take carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) out of transport fuel in the coming years and will be a vital part of the future energy mix.</p> \n<p>The joint venture also combines Shell's expertise and technology partnerships in advanced biofuels with Cosan's experience in the commercial production of low-carbon biofuels. This has the potential to accelerate the commercial production of biofuels from crop waste and inedible plants.</p> \n<p>Ra&iacute;zen's 24 mills can process up to 62 million tonnes of cane into sugar or ethanol each year, with the flexibility to adapt to market demand.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are building a leading position in the most efficient ethanol-producing country in the world,” says Peter Voser, Shell Chief Executive Officer. &quot;Low-carbon, sustainable biofuels will be increasingly important in the global transport fuel mix.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;This is a turning point in the search for alternative energy sources,&quot; says Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello, Cosan's Chairman of the Board. &quot;Ra&iacute;zen is one of Brazil's largest companies and is ready to offer international markets a clean, renewable and economically viable solution.&quot;</p><h2>Meeting demand</h2><p>New energy policies in Europe and the USA are calling for more renewable, lower-carbon fuels for transport. Biofuels make up around 4% of transport fuel in Europe, and 3% in the USA. Globally biofuels currently meet around 3% of road-transport fuel demand. Shell expects this to rise to about 9% by 2030.</p> \n<p>Brazil leads the world in the use of biofuels for transport. They are likely to make up more than 40% of the country's transport fuel mix by 2030, double today's proportion. Ra&iacute;zen's current annual production capacity will be enough to meet nearly 9% of Brazil's current ethanol demand.</p> \n<p>At the pump Brazilian motorists are offered the choice of pure ethanol or a blend of petrol (gasoline) and ethanol. Around 90% of the country's new cars can run on either fuel type.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Ra&iacute;zen business model, which combines Shell and Cosan assets and has direct access to consumers, is a breakthrough in the biofuels sector,” says Marcos Marinho Lutz, Cosan Chief Executive Officer.</p> \n<p>The sugar-cane-to-ethanol process used by Ra&iacute;zen is the most efficient in turning biomass into fuel. Brazilian sugar cane yields 7,000 litres of ethanol per hectare of cane compared to, for example, 3,800 litres for a hectare of corn in the USA and 2,500 litres for a hectare of wheat in Europe, according to Unica, the Brazilian sugar-cane industry association.</p> \n<p>&quot;Sugar cane is the most efficient plant we know in converting sunlight into energy,&quot; says Professor Edgar de Beauclair, of the Crop Production Department S&atilde;o Paulo State University.</p><h2>Better biofuels</h2><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/24A-NfDEsno?rel=0\"></iframe><p>Turning sugar cane into ethanol offers a number of environmental benefits over other biofuel production processes. As it grows, sugar cane generally absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> at a greater rate than other biofuel crops such as soy.</p> \n<p>Ethanol made from Brazilian sugar cane produces around 70% less CO<sub>2</sub> than petrol, when the cultivation and production processes are taken into account. Since 2003 the use of ethanol in Brazil has avoided over 103 million tonnes of the CO<sub>2</sub> that the petrol it has replaced would have produced, according to Unica.</p> \n<p>By-products from turning sugar cane into ethanol are recycled as organic fertiliser. Plant waste, called bagasse, is burned to produce power for the processing mills and surplus energy is supplied to the national grid.</p> \n<p>To further improve productivity, Ra&iacute;zen will use its own advanced geographical information system to monitor its land. This allows its scientists to make accurate predictions about crop yields and adjust fertiliser or pest control, for example, to help boost production.</p> \n<p>&quot;Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol is one of the most sustainable and lowest-CO<sub>2</sub> biofuels available,&quot; says Mark Gainsborough, Shell Executive Vice-President Alternative Energies. &quot;We expect the development of advanced biofuels to benefit from Cosan's feedstock and its expertise in large-scale biofuels production. This has the potential to accelerate the future commercial viability of cellulosic ethanol.&quot;</p> \n<p>The deal includes part of Shell's interest in the firm Iogen, which uses enzymes to break down plant waste into ethanol, as well as Shell's interest in Codexis, developers of &quot;super-enzymes&quot; for the faster conversion of plant waste into transport fuels.</p><h2>Sustainable production</h2><p>Ra&iacute;zen will work to improve the sustainability of its operations. Sugar cane for ethanol requires little water to be added because Brazil's tropical rainfall provides natural irrigation. In the industrial process Ra&iacute;zen has been introducing a system that recycles up to 90% of water used.</p> \n<p>Ra&iacute;zen supports the development of varieties of sugar cane to suit regional climate and resist disease. To protect cane from pests, it breeds and releases natural predators, further reducing the use of chemical pesticides.</p> \n<p>As a member of Bonsucro, formerly the Better Sugarcane Initiative, Ra&iacute;zen has joined with other producers, non-governmental organisations and other experts to establish an EU-approved certificate for sustainable sugar-cane production. This covers areas such as human rights and the impact of activities on biodiversity.</p> \n<p>Ra&iacute;zen is working towards achieving certification for all ethanol produced by its own operations over the coming years. It also plans to have certified all ethanol produced from suppliers' cane.</p> \n<p>Current sugar-cane production in Brazil takes up 8.1 million hectares, around 0.9% of the country's land. Government legislation forbids industries from entering sensitive areas such as rainforests or land needed for other food crops, and from displacing food crops into other sensitive areas. National laws also recognise the rights of indigenous communities and their claims to land ownership. The main sugar-growing areas are hundreds of kilometres from the Amazon rainforest.</p> \n<p>Ra&iacute;zen is well advanced in phasing in mechanised harvesting, ahead of requirements due to come into force in the main Brazilian sugar-cane growing state of S&atilde;o Paulo in 2014. It already uses machines on around 64% of its suitable land (with a slope of less than 12%). CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be reduced because it avoids the need to burn the hard straw, a necessary step in manual cutting.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p>For more information, interview requests or photography, please contact:</p> \n<p><br /><strong>Shell Media Relations <br /></strong>David Williams +31 70 377 3600</p> \n<p><br /><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br /></strong>Europe - Gustavo Bursztyn: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States - Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069<br /><br /><strong>Cosan Media Relations<br /></strong>Daniela Christov&atilde;o +55 11 3897 9797 <br /></p> \n<p><br /><strong>Cautionary note<br /></strong>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

          "summary": "<p>Shell announces final investment decision on Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia.</p>",
          "maintext": "<p>The Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) has taken the final investment decision on the Prelude Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) Project in Australia (100% Shell), building the world’s first FLNG facility. Moored far out to sea, some 200 kilometres from the nearest land in Australia, the FLNG facility will produce gas from offshore fields, and liquefy it onboard by cooling.</p> \n<p>The decision means that Shell is now ready to start detailed design and construction of what will be the world’s largest floating offshore facility, in a ship yard in South Korea.</p> \n<p>From bow to stern, Shell’s FLNG facility will be 488 metres long, and will be the largest floating offshore facility in the world – longer than four soccer fields laid end to end.&nbsp; When fully equipped and with its storage tanks full, it will weigh around 600,000 tonnes – roughly six times as much as the largest aircraft carrier. Some 260,000 tonnes of that weight will consist of steel&nbsp;– around five times more than was used to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</p> \n<p>“Our innovative FLNG technology will allow us to develop offshore gas fields that otherwise would be too costly to develop,” said Malcolm Brinded, Shell’s Executive Director, Upstream International. “Our decision to go ahead with this project is a true breakthrough for the LNG industry, giving it a significant boost to help meet the world’s growing demand for the cleanest-burning fossil fuel.”</p> \n<p>Brinded continued “FLNG technology is an exciting innovation, complementary to onshore LNG, which can help accelerate the development of gas resources”.</p> \n<p>The facility has been designed to withstand the severest cyclones - those of Category 5. Ocean-going LNG carriers will offload liquefied gas, chilled to minus 162 Celsius and shrunk in volume by 600 times, and other products, directly from the facility out at sea for delivery to markets worldwide. Until now, the liquefaction of offshore gas has always involved piping the gas to a land-based plant.</p> \n<p>Shell has progressed the Prelude FLNG project at a rapid pace, with first production of LNG expected some ten years after the gas was discovered.</p> \n<p>The FLNG facility will tap around 3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of resources contained in the Prelude gas field. Shell discovered the Prelude gas field in 2007.</p> \n<p>Some 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of expected production from Prelude should underpin at least 5.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquids, comprising 3.6 mtpa of LNG, 1.3 mtpa of condensate and 0.4 mtpa of liquefied petroleum gas. The FLNG facility will stay permanently moored at the Prelude gas field for 25 years, and in later development phases should produce from other fields in the area where Shell has an interest.</p> \n<p>Ann Pickard, Country Chair of Shell in Australia said “this will be a game changer for the energy industry. We will be deploying this revolutionary technology first in Australian waters, where it will add another dimension to Australia’s already vibrant gas industry.”</p> \n<p>Brinded added “beyond this, our ambition is to develop more FLNG projects globally. Our design can accommodate a range of gas fields, and our strategic partnership with Technip and Samsung should enable us to apply it progressively faster for future projects. We see opportunities around the world to work on other FLNG projects with governments, energy companies and customers.”</p> \n<p>Shell’s decision to make FLNG a reality culminates more than a decade of research and development. It builds on the company’s extensive know-how in offshore production, gas liquefaction, LNG shipping, and delivering major projects that integrate the gas value chain—from wellhead to burner.</p> \n<p>The Prelude FLNG project will be the first Australian upstream project in which Shell is the operator. Australia is one of Shell’s key growth provinces, and Shell’s upstream investment in Australia should reach some $30 billion over the next five years, including the Prelude and Gorgon projects, and on-going exploration and feasibility studies in the country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Prelude FLNG is part of Shell’s industry-leading portfolio of medium term growth options, where the company has around 30 new upstream projects under study world-wide, to support long term profitable growth.</p><h2>Enquiries</h2><p><strong>Shell Media Relations<br /></strong>Australia -&nbsp;Claire Wilkinson: +61 416924822<br />Group -&nbsp;Kirsten Smart:&nbsp;+31 70 377 3600</p> \n<p><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br /></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br />United States – Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><h2>Notes to editors</h2><p>Shell is a global, integrated energy company with operations in more than 90 countries and territories, with businesses including: oil and gas exploration and production; refineries and chemical plants; processing and marketing of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquid (GTL) products; marketing and shipping of oil products and chemicals; and renewable energy sources, such as biofuels.</p> \n<p>Gas resources are found all over the world in remote offshore accumulations. In Australian waters alone there is an estimated 140 trillion cubic feet of such “stranded” gas, according to a 2008 report by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (http://www.solve.csiro.au/0608/article5.htm). Shell FLNG technology will make it feasible to develop such resources, since it reduces both the cost and environmental footprint of their development. Having the gas-processing and gas-liquefaction facility located at the site of an offshore field removes the need for: gas-compression platforms; long subsea pipelines to shore; near-shore works, such as dredging and jetty construction; and onshore construction, including roads, storage yards and accommodation facilities. Another plus is that FLNG can accelerate LNG developments. This is because an FLNG vessel can be ordered at an earlier stage of appraisal of a new gas field, with less guarantee of production longevity than needed to underpin an onshore greenfield investment; if and when the gas resources in the first field are exhausted, the FLNG can be redeployed to another field.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://shell.qbank.se/v2.7/mb.php?h=49b1a991cc56d21a8a258f29cdda0578\">Download an animation and graphics/visuals of Prelude FLNG</a></li></ul><p>Shell is the operator and 100% equity holder of the WA-371-P permit in the Browse Basin, where the Prelude field is located.

          "summary": "<p>Shell is building the world’s first floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project which has the potential to revolutionise the way natural gas resources are developed. It will help to unlock vital energy resources offshore, without the need to lay pipelines and build processing plants on land.</p>\n",
          "maintext": "<p>Hundreds of engineers from across the world have combined their experience and expertise to design the world’s largest floating offshore&nbsp; facility. It will be used to help open up new natural gas fields at sea that are currently considered too costly or difficult to develop.</p> \n<p>Shell is a pioneer in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Chilling gas to -162&deg; Celsius (-260&deg;F) turns it into liquid and shrinks its volume by 600 times, allowing it to be shipped to far-off towns and cities where the energy is needed.<br /> </p> \n<p>We have five decades of experience in the LNG industry. Moving the production and processing out to sea where the gas is found is a major innovation that brings huge new energy resources within reach.</p> \n<p>It also avoids the potential environmental impact of constructing and operating a plant on land, including laying pipelines to shore and building other infrastructure.</p> \n<p>The first site to use Shell’s FLNG will be the Prelude gas field, 200 kilometres (around 125 miles) off Australia’s north-west coast.</p> \n<p>Shell has progressed the Prelude FLNG project at rapid pace.<br /> <br /> “This is revolutionary technology developed by Shell,” says Neil Gilmour, Shell Vice President Integrated Gas Development. “It has the potential to change the way we produce natural gas.”<br /> </p> \n<p>The Prelude FLNG facility will produce at least 5.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquids: 3.6 mtpa of LNG – enough to easily satisfy Hong Kong’s annual natural gas needs – 0.4 mtpa of liquefied petroleum gas and 1.3mtpa of condensate (equivalent to 35,000 bbl/d).</p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/aboutshell/imgs/240-wide/flng-240.gif\" alt=\"The Prelude FLNG facility will be moored around 200 km  off the coast of Australia \"/><h2>Huge and compact</h2><p>Once complete, the facility will have decks measuring 488 by 74 metres, the length of more than four soccer fields. With its cargo tanks full it will weigh roughly six times as much as the largest aircraft carrier.<br /> <br /> More than 600 people around the world spent over 1.6 million hours working on different design options for the facility.</p> \n<p>“This has never been done before,” says Neil. “We had to find ways to adapt our technology for off shore.”<br /> </p> \n<p>Despite its impressive proportions, the facility is one-quarter the size of an equivalent plant on land. Engineers have designed components that will stack vertically to save space. </p> \n<p>The operating plant, for example, will be placed above LNG storage tanks.<br /> <br /> They also came up with the idea of tapping the cold of the ocean depths by pumping water to help cool the gas, avoiding the need to for extra equipment on deck.<br /> </p> \n<p>“For LNG you need a cooling medium, like in your fridge at home,” says Neil. “We’ve invented a system to take water from deep in the ocean.”<br /> </p> \n<p>An assembly of eight one-metre diameter pipes will extend from the facility to about 150 m below the ocean’s surface.</p> \n<p>It will deliver around 50,000 m3 of cold seawater each hour. This helps to cool the gas from below the facility, saving deck space.</p><img src=\"http://s05.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/aboutshell/imgs/352-wide/flng-352.gif\" alt=\"FLNG will help to unlock vital energy resources off shore\"/><h2>Staying firm</h2><p>The FLNG facility is designed to operate and stay safely moored even in the most extreme weather conditions.<br /> <br /> The sheer size of the full-scale facility will help it to withstand very high winds and giant waves. In addition, it will be secured in place by one of the largest mooring systems in the world. </p> \n<p>A 93-metre (105-foot) high turret, spacious enough to house the Arc de Triomphe, will run through the facility. Four groups of mooring lines will anchor it to the seabed.<br /> <br /> The system allows the facility to turn slowly in the wind – absorbing the impact of strong weather conditions – while remaining moored over the gas field. It can stay safely moored at sea even during the most powerful cyclones. </p> \n<p>This saves valuable production days that would otherwise be lost on disconnecting the facility and moving it off the field.<br /> <br /> Three 6,700-horsepower thrusters will sit in the rear of the facility. Two of these will operate at any one time to turn the facility out of the wind and allow LNG carriers to pull safely alongside to load. </p> \n<p>The facility’s storage tanks will be below deck. They can store up to 220,000 m3 of LNG, 90,000 m3 of LPG, and 126,000 m3 of condensate. The total storage capacity is equivalent to around 175 Olympic swimming pools.</p> \n<p><a></a><br /> </p><img src=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/aboutshell/imgs/352-wide/flng-marin-test.jpg\" alt=\"A scale model of the facility measures eight metres long and weighs 4.5 tonnes\"/>",
