		"title": "Royal Dutch Shell plc second quarter 2012 scrip dividend programme reference share price",
		"maintext": "<h3>Reference Share Price</h3><p>The Reference Share price is used for calculating a Participating Shareholder's entitlement under the Scrip Dividend Programme, as defined below.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q2 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Reference share price (US$)</td><td>35.425</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The Reference Share Price is the US dollar equivalent of the average of the closing price for the Company's A Shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam for the five dealing days commencing on (& including) the date on which the Shares are first quoted ex-dividend in respect of the relevant dividend.<br/><br/>The Reference Share Price is calculated by reference to the Euronext Amsterdam closing price in euro. The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.</p><h3>Reference ADS Price</h3><p>ADS stands for \"American Depositary Share\". ADR stands for \"American Depositary Receipt\". An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR & ADS are often used interchangeably).  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q2 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Reference ADS price (US$)</td><td>70.850</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.  A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary.  Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.  The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs & B ADSs.<br/><br/>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.  Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website: <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.</p><h3>Scrip dividend programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br/><br/>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.|<br/><br/>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br/><br/>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br/><br/>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br/><br/>Shareholders who held only B shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br/><br/>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",

		"maintext": "<p>The Beryl Area includes 12 fields located on the UK Continental Shelf. The fields are operated by Apache & with the acquisition Shell\u2019s interest in the different fields will increase by a range of between 9-65% depending on the field.</p><p>The Beryl cluster has a far longer anticipated lifetime than originally thought & may produce for a further two decades. The acquisition should help to enhance the performance & economic potential from key Shell North Sea operated & non-operated assets, lifting Shell\u2019s production in the Beryl area fields from currently 9 thousand boe/d to 24 thousand boe/d. Shell intends to invest in these assets to substantially extend the production life, for potentially a further 20 years.</p><h3>Notes to editors</h3><p>1. Shell is a leading operator in the UK sector of the North Sea & intends to maintain this position. Offshore, Shell has interests in more than 50 fields, operates more than 30 platform installations, 30 subsea installations & one production (FPSO) vessel. Onshore, we operate three gas plants; the St. Fergus Gas Terminal & Fife NGL Plant (with Braefoot Bay marine terminal) in Scotl&, & Bacton in the east of England. Shell operates a significant number of its interests in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) on behalf of a 50:50 joint venture with ExxonMobil. The Shell share of UK oil & gas production is about 8% (140 kboe/d in 2011). Almost half of this is gas. This is almost 4% of total Shell Group production.</p><p>2. Shell & Hess Corporation signed an agreement on May 29, 2012 to acquire Hess\u2019s 15.67% interest in the BP operated Schiehallion field. The sale which completed on 28 September 2012 brings Shell\u2019s equity in Schiehallion to 49%.</p><p>3. In 2010 we increased our interest in the Clair field from 18% to 28%. Clair lies west of Shetl& & is operated by BP.</p><p>4. The increase in Shell share of fields is as follows: Beryl, Nevis Central, Nevis North, Nevis Far North, Nevis South Cormorant, Loirston, Ness & Ness South from 23% to 45%. Nevis South from 14.8% to 52.2%. On Nevis West Beryl from 0% to 65.5%.

		"title": "Major construction begins on the Prelude FLNG project - the world's biggest offshore floating facility",
		"maintext": "<p>Shell\u2019s Projects &amp; Technology Director Matthias Bichsel commented:  \"We are cutting 7.6 tonnes of steel for the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility today, but in total, more than 260,000 tonnes of steel will be fabricated & assembled for the facility.  That\u2019s around five times the amount of steel used to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Today\u2019s ceremony marks a major milestone in this project, when the innovative thinking & new technology & engineering solutions which will make FLNG possible begin to be realised.\"  </p><p>When completed, the Prelude FLNG facility will be 488 metres long & 74 metres wide, making it the largest offshore floating facility ever built.  When fully equipped & with its cargo tanks full, it will weigh more than 600,000 tonnes.  There will be over 3,000 kilometres of electrical & instrumentation cables on the FLNG facility, the distance from Barcelona to Moscow.</p><p>\"Making FLNG a reality is no simple feat,\" Matthias continued.  \"Shell is uniquely positioned to make it a success given our commercial capability; our LNG, offshore, deepwater & marine technology; & our proven ability to successfully deliver megaprojects.\" </p><p>In order to meet the world\u2019s growing energy demand, bringing new supplies to market is critical. The Prelude FLNG facility will be deployed in Australian waters over 200 kilometres from the nearest point on the coast.  It will produce gas at sea, turn it into liquefied natural gas & then transfer it directly to the ships that will transport it to customers. </p><p>An expert team from Shell will manage the multi-year construction of the FLNG facility to ensure the Prelude project\u2019s critical dimensions of safety, quality, cost & schedule are delivered.  Strategic partners Technip & Samsung Heavy Industries (the Technip Samsung Consortium) along with SBM & hundreds of suppliers & contractors around the world are all contributing valuable knowledge, skills & equipment to help make the project a success.  At peak levels, around 5,000 people will be working on the construction of the FLNG facility in South Korea; & another 1,000 will build the turret mooring system, subsea & wells equipment in other locations across the globe.</p><p>In the lead up to the facility being ready to start production, a number of actions will take place, such as drilling the production wells, installation of subsea flowlines & risers & mooring chains to prepare for the arrival of the FLNG facility.</p><p>Prelude FLNG is the latest in a line of Shell achievements in developing new technologies for the oil & gas industry, reinforcing its leadership in technology & innovation.  This is the first of what Shell expects to be multiple Shell FLNG projects.</p><h3>Notes to editors</h3><p>In 2012, Australian subsidiaries of INPEX Corporation (17.5%) & Korea Gas Corporation (10%) joined the Prelude FLNG project.  An Australian subsidiary of CPC Corporation (5%) has also signed an agreement to do so.  Completion of this transaction remains subject to conditions including Taiwanese government approval. By taking a stake in the project, INPEX, KOGAS & CPC show the confidence they place in Shell\u2019s FLNG technology.</p><p>FLNG will enable the development of gas resources ranging from clusters of smaller more remote fields to potentially larger fields via multiple facilities where, for a range of reasons, an onshore development is not viable. This can mean faster, cheaper, more flexible development & deployment strategies for resources that were previously uneconomic, or constrained by technical or other risks.</p><p>Many of the technologies used on the FLNG facility are ones that Shell has used successfully onshore, but some have been extended or modified for offshore.  The new technologies that Shell developed for FLNG include:  managing sloshing in LNG tanks; systems for managing the close coupling between the producing wells & the LNG processing facility; LNG offloading arms; water intake risers;  mooring systems; & the marinisation of processing equipment such as absorption columns & the main cryogenic heat exchangers.  All of these technologies have been extensively modelled & tested to ensure they can operate safely & efficiently under marine conditions.</p><p>Shell\u2019s innovation in FLNG has been recognised by the industry including:</p><ul><li>Lloyd\u2019s List award for Technological Innovation 2012 </li><li>CWC / WGI LNG Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Industry 2011</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://shell.qbank.se/v2.7/mb.php?h=b8bb32c8c976a2b5f4b3450cf4d1a2d4\">Download images from the steel cutting</a></li></ul><h3>Enquiries</h3><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong></p><p>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550<br/>Australia: +61 417 007 344</p><p><strong>Shell Investor Relations<br/></strong>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br/>United States \u2013 Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong>Cautionary note</strong></p><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly & indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

		"maintext": "<p>Over the last several days, Shell has successfully completed a series of tests of the first-ever Arctic Containment System. However, during a final test, the containment dome aboard the Arctic Challenger barge was damaged. It is clear that some days will be required to repair & fully assess dome readiness. We are disappointed that the dome has not yet met our stringent acceptance standards; but, as we have said all along, we will not conduct any operation until we are satisfied that we are fully prepared to do it safely. <br/><br/>The time required to repair the dome, along with steps we have taken to protect local whaling operations & to ensure the safety of operations from ice floe movement, have led us to revise our plans for the 2012-2013 exploration program. In order to lay a strong foundation for operations in 2013, we will forgo drilling into hydrocarbon zones this year. Instead, we will begin as many wells, known as â\u20AC˜top holes,\u2019 as time remaining in this season allows. The top portion of the wells drilled in the days & weeks ahead will be safely capped & temporarily ab&oned this year, in accordance with regulatory requirements. We look forward to the final receipt of our drilling permits for the multi-year exploration program upon the successful testing & deployment of the Arctic Containment System.<br/><br/>These capabilities have, most recently, been evident in Shell\u2019s ice management operations as it successfully moved one of its drill ships & support vessels safely out of the path of approaching sea ice. That drill ship, the Noble Discoverer, is expected to resume its position & drilling operations over the â\u20AC˜Burger A\u2019 prospect in the days ahead. <br/><br/>Also, in the coming days, Shell is expected to begin exploratory drilling in the Beaufort Sea. These operations will follow the conclusion of the fall whale hunt & the anticipated receipt of a top hole drilling permit. <br/><br/>We have tested & assembled drill ships & support vessels, trained personnel, & acquired numerous final approved plans & permits. This exploration program remains critically important to America\u2019s energy needs, to the economy & jobs in Alaska, & to Shell.</p><h3>Enquiries </h3><p><strong>Shell Media Relations</strong><br/>International, UK, European Press: +44 207 934 5550 <br/><br/><strong>Shell Investor Relations</strong><br/>Europe - Tjerk Huysinga: + 31 70 377 3996 <br/>United States - Ken Lawrence: +1 713 241 2069</p><p><strong><br/>Cautionary note </strong><br/>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly & indirectly owns investments are separate entities.
