The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.</p><h3>Reference ADS Price</h3><p>ADS stands for \"American Depositary Share\". ADR stands for \"American Depositary Receipt\". An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR & ADS are often used interchangeably).  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A & RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q2 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Reference ADS price (US$)</td><td>70.850</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.  A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary.  Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.  The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs & B ADSs.<br/><br/>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.  Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website: <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.</p><h3>Scrip dividend programme </h3><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br/><br/>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.|<br/><br/>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) & will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br/><br/>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br/><br/>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br/><br/>Shareholders who held only B shares & joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br/><br/>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p>",
