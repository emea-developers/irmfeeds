      "summary": "<p>Our strategy seeks to reinforce our position as a leader in the oil and gas industry while helping to meet global energy demand in a responsible way. We strive to create competitive returns for shareholders. Safety, environmental and social responsibility are at the heart of our activities.</p>\n",
      "maintext": "<p>Intense competition exists for access to upstream resources and to new downstream markets. But we believe our technology, project-delivery capability and operational excellence will remain key differentiators for our businesses. We expect around 80% of our capital investment in 2013 to be in our Upstream businesses.</p> \n<p>In Upstream we focus on exploration for new liquids and natural gas reserves and on developing major new projects where our technology and know-how add value to the resource holders.</p> \n<p>We focus on a series of strategic themes, each requiring distinctive technologies and risk management:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Our upstream and downstream ‘engines’ are strongly cash generative, mature businesses, which will underpin our financial performance to at least the end of this decade.&nbsp; Here we only make investments in selective growth positions and we apply Shell’s distinctive technology and operating performance to extend the productive lives of our assets and to enhance their profitability.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Our growth priorities are in three strategic themes, namely integrated gas, deep water and resources plays such as shale oil and gas (“unconventionals”). These will provide our medium-term growth, and we expect them to become core engines in the future. Here, we use the advantages of Shell’s technological know-how and global scale to unlock highly competitive resource positions.<br /> <br /> </li> \n <li>Our future opportunities include the Arctic, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and heavy oil, where there are large reserves positions potentially available, with the pace of development driven by market and local operating conditions.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Meeting the growing demand for energy worldwide in ways that minimise environmental and social impact is a major challenge for the global energy industry. We aim to improve energy efficiency in our own operations, supporting customers in managing their energy demands, and continuing to research and develop technologies that increase efficiency and reduce emissions in liquids and natural gas production.</p> \n<p>Our commitment to technology and innovation continues to be at the core of our strategy. As energy projects become more complex and more technically demanding, we believe our engineering expertise will be a deciding factor in the growth of our businesses. Our key strengths include the development and application of technology, the financial and project-management skills that allow us to deliver large field development projects, and the management of integrated value chains. We aim to leverage our diverse and global business portfolio and customer-focused businesses built around the strength of the Shell brand.</p> \n<p>See how this strategy fits in with Shell’s energy strategy.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/downloads/pdf/investor/strategy/royal-dutch-shell-plc-energy-strategy-2013.pdf\">Shell's energy strategy</a></li></ul><h2>Strategy summary</h2><p><b>UPSTREAM</b></p> \n<p>- growth strategy, price upside&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>- priority: deep-water, integrated gas, resources plays</p><img src=\"http://s04.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/images-text/240-wide/perdido-spar-240.jpg\" alt=\"Perdido spar lying horizontal in Gulf of Mexico\"/><p><b>DOWNSTREAM</b></p> \n<p>- optimise re-shaped portfolio</p> \n<p>- selective growth</p><img src=\"http://s00.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/environment-society/imgs/240-wide/pernis-refinery.jpg\" alt=\"Pernis refinery, Netherlands\"/><p><b>CLIMATE CHANGE</b></p> \n<p>- grow gas and biofuels</p> \n<p>- CCS and energy efficiency</p><img src=\"http://s07.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/images-text/240-wide/sugar-cane-240.jpg\" alt=\"Organic fertiliser for sugar cane\"/><p><b>FINANCIAL OUTLOOK</b></p> \n<p>- Investing for growth and competitive payout</p> \n<p>- Through-cycle returns and risk management</p><img src=\"http://s01.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell-new/local/corporate/corporate/images-text/240-wide/affinity-nanuq-240.jpg\" alt=\"Affinity followed by Nanuq and escorted by Tor Viking\"/>",

      "summary": "<p>We continuously seek to improve our operating performance, with an emphasis on health, safety and environment, asset performance and operating costs. Asset sales are a key element of our strategy – improving our capital efficiency by focusing investment on the most attractive growth opportunities. Sale of non-core assets in 2010-2012 generated some $21 billion in divestment proceeds. Exits from further positions in 2013 are expected to generate up to $3 billion in divestment proceeds.</p>\n",
      "maintext": "<p>We have initiatives underway that are expected to improve Shell’s integrated Downstream business, focusing on the profitability of our portfolio and growth potential.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;In early 2012, Shell set out a new growth agenda, to deliver $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations excluding working capital movements for 2012-2015 in aggregate, some 30-50% higher than in 2008-2011. This assumes that the Brent oil price is in the range of $80-100 per barrel and conditions for North American natural gas and downstream margins improve relative to 2012. This cash flow is to finance a 2012-2015 expected net capital investment programme of $120-130 billion, an increase of some 10-20% compared with the 2008-2011 level, and funding a competitive dividend for shareholders. Shell is on track to deliver these targets.</p> \n<p>In Upstream we have the potential to reach an average production of some 4.0 million boe/d in 2017-2018, compared with 3.3 million boe/d in 2012. Shell’s strategy in Upstream is designed to drive financial growth, with production growth regarded as a proxy for this over the long term.&nbsp; Our 2017-2018 production potential will be driven by the timing of investment decisions and the near-term macroeconomic outlook, and assumes some 250 thousand boe/d of expected asset sales and licence expiries from 2011 to 2017-2018. In Downstream we evaluate selective growth opportunities in chemicals, biofuels and growth markets.</p> \n<p>Shell has built up a substantial portfolio of options for a new wave of growth. This portfolio has been designed to capture energy price upside and manage Shell’s exposure to industry challenges from cost inflation and political risk. Key elements of this opportunity set are in global exploration, and in established provinces in the Gulf of Mexico, North American tight gas, liquids-rich shales and Australian LNG. These projects are part of a portfolio that has the potential to underpin production growth to the end of this decade. Shell is working to mature these projects, with an emphasis on financial returns.</p> \n<p>The statements in this strategy and outlook section do not take into account the impact of the recently announced <a class=\"shell\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/investor/news-and-library/2013/shell-repsol-260213.html\">agreement to acquire part of Repsol S.A.’s LNG portfolio</a>.<br /> </p> \n<p>The statements in this Strategy and Outlook section, including those related to our growth strategies and our expected or potential future cash flow from operations, net capital investment and production, are based on management’s current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance and outcomes to differ materially from those expressed herein.</p>",
