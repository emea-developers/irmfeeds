Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably).  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p> <p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q3 2012</th> </tr> <tr><td>Reference ADS price (US$)</td> <td>65.812</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.  A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary. Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.  The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs and B ADSs.<br/><br/>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.  Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website:  <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Scrip dividend programme <br/></strong>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme. Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.  Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br/><br/>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br/><br/>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br/><br/>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br/><br/>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br/><br/>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p> <p><br/><strong>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br/>The Hague, November 21st, 2012</strong></p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.<br/><br/><strong>Reference ADS Price<br/></strong>ADS stands for “American Depositary Share”. ADR stands for “American Depositary Receipt”. An  ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably).  ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B.  Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p> <p><table><tbody><tr><th> </th><th>Q3 2012</th> </tr> <tr><td>Reference ADS price (US$)</td> <td>65.812</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.  A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary. Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT). Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.  The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs and B ADSs.<br/><br/>Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.  Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website:  <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Scrip dividend programme <br/></strong>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme. Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.  Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br/><br/>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br/><br/>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br/><br/>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br/><br/>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.  However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br/><br/>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p> <p><br/><strong>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br/>The Hague, November 21st, 2012</strong></p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",

Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p><p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.\"</p><p>\"We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.\"</p><p>\"During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.\"</p><p>\"This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,\" Voser continued. \"This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.\"<i>(1)</i></p><p>Voser added: \"We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.\"</p><p>\"The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,\" concluded Voser.</p>",
