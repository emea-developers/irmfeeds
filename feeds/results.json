              "maintext": "<p>“Our industry continues to see significant energy price volatility as a result of economic and political developments. Oil prices have fallen recently but Shell is implementing a long-term, competitive and innovative strategy against this volatile backdrop.”</p> \n<p>“Shell's underlying CCS earnings were $7.5 billion for the quarter, a 2% increase in CCS earnings per share from the first quarter of 2012. These results were underpinned by Shell's growth projects, an improvement in downstream profitability, and were delivered despite a difficult security environment in Nigeria.”</p> \n<p>“Our profits pay for Shell's dividends and investment in new projects to ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies for our customers, and to add value for our shareholders.”</p> \n<p>“Shell is investing for profitable growth, whilst maintaining strong capital discipline. We are developing some 30 new projects and maturing a series of further opportunities for investment. So far this year, we’ve seen the growth impact of recent start ups and we took four final investment decisions in petrochemicals, deepwater, and LNG.”</p> \n<p>“We continue to take a dynamic approach to portfolio” continued Voser. “Asset sales - $0.6 billion in the first quarter and over $21 billion in the last three years - improve our capital efficiency and can bring in strategic partners. We use selective acquisitions to refresh our opportunity set.”</p> \n<p>Voser commented “We distributed $11 billion of dividends over the last year, the highest in our industry, and today we confirm a 5% rise in our dividend to $0.45 per share.”</p> \n<p>He concluded “Dividends are Shell’s main route for returning cash to shareholders. Our improving cash flow also enables us to accelerate our share buyback programme, this year so far we have repurchased some $1.2 billion of shares by the end of April. In the current environment we would expect to more than offset the scrip dividend issue this year, and we are determined to implement the policy to offset dilution over the business cycle. This underlines our commitment to shareholder returns.”<br /> </p>",

These results were undermined by a number of factors – but they were clearly disappointing for Shell“, continued Voser.</p> \n<p>Oil theft and disruptions to gas supplies in Nigeria are causing widespread environmental damage, and could cost the Nigerian government $12 billion in lost revenues per year. “We will play our part, but these are problems Shell cannot solve alone,” Voser said.</p> \n<p>“We’ve made substantial improvements to our portfolio in the last few years. Today, Shell is rich with new investment opportunities and is capital constrained – the opposite position to where the company was in the middle of the last decade.”</p> \n<p>“Shell is investing in new capacity worldwide, to generate profitable growth for shareholders. In the next 18 months we expect to see five major project start-ups, which should add over $4 billion to our 2015 cash flow (1).</p> \n<p>We’ve embedded rigorous portfolio management into Shell, to improve our capital efficiency and refresh the portfolio for growth. We have completed some $21 billion of divestments in the last three years and some $4 billion in the last 12 months alone, with more to come.</p> \n<p>Shell is entering a new phase of more substantial portfolio change, which will lead to a higher rate of divestments in the coming years.</p> \n<p>We have recently launched strategic portfolio reviews in both Nigeria onshore and North America resources plays, which will lead to further focus and divestments there, as we continue to shape the company for the future.</p> \n<p>Our strategy is to deliver sustainable growth in cash generation through the business cycle, underpinning Shell’s competitive dividends and returns. We are not targeting oil and gas production volumes; rather we are focusing on financial performance.”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded, “Shell’s sustained investment in new growth projects will drive our financial performance. Dividends are Shell’s main route for returning cash to shareholders and we have distributed more than $11 billion of dividends in the last 12 months. So far this year, we have repurchased more than $3 billion of shares, and we are on track for $4-5 billion of share buy-backs in 2013. This underlines our commitment to shareholder returns.”</p> \n<p><br /> <br /> <i>(1) Projects comprised of Mars B and Cardamom in deep-water Gulf of Mexico, Gumusut-Kakap in deep-water Malaysia, Kashagan Phase 1 in Kazakhstan and the completion of the acquisition of part of Repsol S.A.’s LNG portfolio.

ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h2>Scrip Dividend Programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.&nbsp; Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p> \n<p>For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on www.shell.com/scrip.</p><h2>Dividend timetable for the second quarter 2013 interim dividend</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>&nbsp;</th> \n   <th><p>2nd quarter 2013</p> </th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Announcement date</th> \n   <td>August 1, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Ex-dividend date</th> \n   <td>August 14, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Record date&nbsp;</th> \n   <td>August 16, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th> \n   <td>August 21, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><i><b>(*)</b></i></sup></th> \n   <td>September 2, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</th> \n   <td>September 9, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Payment date</th> \n   <td>September 26, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

              "maintext": "<p>“We are making good progress against our targets to deliver a more competitive performance. Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.</p> \n<p>Shell’s first quarter 2012 earnings increased from year-ago levels, through a combination of improved operating performance, increased upstream volumes and strong oil prices. Energy demand fundamentals are robust, but with near-term volatility in energy prices as a result of economic and political events. In downstream and North American natural gas we see continued challenges for our industry.”</p> \n<p>“We are implementing our strategy by improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. Shell sold $2.4 billion of upstream and downstream positions during the quarter, enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential. Asset sales for 2012 are likely to be over $4 billion, compared with our earlier guidance of $2-3 billion.”</p> \n<p>“During the quarter, production commenced at the Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia reached ready-for-start-up status. These two non-operated positions are expected to add a total of some 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“boe/d”) at peak for Shell and 0.9 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of LNG capacity. The ramp-up of Shell’s flagship Pearl GTL project in Qatar continued during the quarter, and the project is on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012. In the last few weeks, crude oil processing commenced at the Port Arthur refinery expansion project, creating one of the largest refineries in the United States.”</p> \n<p>“This is all part of a portfolio of 26 projects that Shell is developing worldwide today,” Voser continued. “This industry-leading project line-up, combined with a focus on innovation and competitive performance across the company, will drive Shell to the clear targets we have set out for shareholders, namely around $175-200 billion of cash flow from operations in total for 2012-15, and a production potential of some 4 million boe/d in 2017-18.”(1)</p> \n<p>Voser added: “We continue to mature new investment options for medium-term growth, including new exploration acreage and positive results from the on-going appraisal of the Appomattox oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, where we see scope for some 500 million boe of resources with further upside potential. I am also very pleased to welcome new strategic partners into Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG project in Australia, as we continue to develop new international natural gas resources and markets.”</p> \n<p>“The resumption of measured, affordable dividend growth we have confirmed today reflects the improving financial position of the company and delivery of our strategy,” concluded Voser.<br /> </p>",

Our profits have fallen with energy prices, but our growth strategy is delivering to the bottom line.</p> \n<p>Shell’s second quarter 2012 earnings declined from year-ago levels, with weaker oil and North American gas prices offsetting the benefit of increased upstream volumes and improved refining margins. Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new projects, to ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies for our customers, adding value for our shareholders.”</p> \n<p>Voser continued: “Our industry continues to see significant energy price volatility as a result of economic and political developments. Shell is implementing a long-term, consistent strategy against this volatile backdrop. Our plans for organic capital investment of around $32 billion in 2012 and medium-term financial and production growth are on track.</p> \n<p>Shell has continuous improvement programmes in place to increase operational uptime and performance and to control costs. The new projects we’ve built in recent years are driving growth in the company today, and our investment decisions should drive oil and gas production for decades to come, with more than 20 key upstream projects under construction today.”</p> \n<p>“We want leadership positions in the plays where we choose to invest, such as deepwater, integrated gas, tight gas and traditional basins, creating value for shareholders with Shell’s investment, people and innovation,” Voser said.</p> \n<p>“Looking further into the future, Shell is following a deliberate strategy to bring more choice into the company’s next tranche of investment decisions, generating a larger range of new investment choices and growth pathways. Capital efficiency is an important part of Shell’s approach, with on-going actions to sell non-core positions, to form strategic partnerships and to add new growth positions.</p> \n<p>Shell has continued to build high potential exploration acreage positions in 2012, including new liquids-rich shale and deepwater plays, and we are drilling important new wells over the next few months. In addition, Shell is assessing new integrated gas options in North America.”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded: “Our strategy is focused on innovation and competitiveness. There is more to come from Shell.”<br /> </p>",

ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.</p> \n<br />Scrip Dividend Programme \n<strong></strong> \n<p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends, if approved by the Board. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.</p> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on \n<a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>. \n<br />Dividend timetable for the&nbsp;third quarter 2012 interim dividend\n<br /> \n<br /><h2></h2><table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th> &nbsp; </th> \n   <th> <p>3rd&nbsp;quarter 2012</p> </th> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Announcement date </th> \n   <td> November 1, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Ex-dividend date </th> \n   <td> November 14,&nbsp;2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Record date&nbsp; </th> \n   <td> November 16, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Scrip reference share price announcement date </th> \n   <td> November 21, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><strong><em>(*)</em></strong></sup> </th> \n   <td> November 30, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date </th> \n   <td> December 7, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Payment date </th> \n   <td> December 20, 2012 </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table><em>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders. <br />Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom and their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.</p> \n<p>The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the third quarter 2012 interim dividend of US$0.43 is US$0.05 per ordinary share and the dividend and tax credit together amount to US$0.48.

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency exchange rate prevailing at the time.<br /> <br /> <b>Reference ADS Price</b></p> \n<p>ADS stands for “American Depositary Share”. ADR stands for “American Depositary Receipt”. An&nbsp; ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably).&nbsp; ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B.&nbsp; Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.</p><h2></h2><table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th> &nbsp; </th> \n   <th> Q3 2012 </th> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Reference ADS price (US$) </td> \n   <td> 65.812 </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table><p>The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.&nbsp; A recent court ruling has established that Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is not due on the issue of shares to a US depositary.&nbsp;Therefore, the Reference ADS price no longer includes an adjustment for the deduction of SDRT (or the Dutch withholding tax associated with the payment of SDRT).&nbsp;Given these changes, there is no longer a need to have an Alternative Reference ADS Price.&nbsp; The Reference ADS Price will instead apply to all A ADSs and B ADSs.<br /> <br /> Royal Dutch Shell plc is currently exploring together with the Depository how ADS holders might reclaim SDRT amounts deducted on previous issues under the Scrip Dividend Programme.&nbsp; Details will be made available as soon as possible on the dividend section of the Royal Dutch Shell plc website:&nbsp; <a class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/dividend\">www.shell.com/dividend</a>.<br /> <br /> <b><br /> Scrip dividend programme</b></p> \n<p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme. Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS.&nbsp; Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br /> <br /> Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.&nbsp; However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.<br /> <br /> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\" href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.<br /> </p> \n<p><b>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br /> The Hague, November 21st, 2012</b><br /> </p>",

The first quarter 2013 interim dividend is scheduled to be announced on May 2, 2013.<br /> <br /> RDS provides eligible shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme (“the Programme”). For further details please see below.</p><h2>Details relating to the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><p>It is expected that cash dividends on the B Shares will be paid via the Dividend Access Mechanism from UK-sourced income of the Shell Group.</p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ordinary share</th> \n   <th>Q4 2012</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.43</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B shares (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.43</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on A Shares will be paid, by default, in euro, although holders of A Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in pounds sterling.</p> \n<p>Cash dividends on B Shares will be paid, by default, in pounds sterling, although holders of B Shares will be able to elect to receive dividends in euro.</p> \n<p>The pounds sterling and euro equivalent dividend payments will be announced on March 8, 2013.</p><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Per ADS</th> \n   <th>Q4 2012</th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS A&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.86</td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>RDS&nbsp;B&nbsp;ADSs (US$)</td> \n   <td>0.86</td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p>Cash dividends on American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) will be paid, by default, in US dollars.<br /> <br /> ADS stands for an American Depositary Share. ADR stands for an American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs. ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two B Shares in the case of RDS.B. In many cases the terms ADR and ADS are used interchangeably.</p><h2>Scrip Dividend Programme</h2><p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.<br /> <br /> Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends, if approved by the Board. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.<br /> <br /> Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.<br /> <br /> Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.<br /> <br /> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>.</p><h2>Dividend timetable for the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend</h2><table> \n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th>&nbsp;</th> \n   <th><p>4th quarter 2012</p> </th> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Announcement date</th> \n   <td>Jan 31, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Ex-dividend date</th> \n   <td>Feb 13, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Record date&nbsp;</th> \n   <td>Feb 15, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Scrip reference share price announcement date</th> \n   <td>Feb 20, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><i><b>(*)</b></i></sup></th> \n   <td>Mar 1, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date</th> \n   <td>Mar 8, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Payment date</th> \n   <td>Mar 28, 2013<br /> </td> \n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table><p><i>* A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders.<br /> Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.

Provided certain conditions are met, shareholders in receipt of A Share cash dividends may also be entitled to a non-payable dividend tax credit in the United Kingdom.<br /> <br /> Shareholders resident in the United Kingdom, receiving cash dividends on B Shares through the Dividend Access Mechanism, are entitled to a tax credit. This tax credit is not repayable. Non-residents may also be entitled to a tax credit, if double tax arrangements between the United Kingdom and their country of residence so provide, or if they are eligible for relief given to non-residents with certain special connections with the United Kingdom or to nationals of states in the European Economic Area.</p> \n<p>The amount of tax credit is 10/90ths of the cash dividend, the tax credit referable to the fourth quarter 2012 interim dividend of US$0.43 is US$0.05 per ordinary share and the dividend and tax credit together amount to US$0.48.

Shell sold $3.2 billion of non-core positions, including tight gas assets in South Texas, in the quarter. Exits from non-core positions continue, with the announcements of further disposals, with proceeds mainly expected during 2011-2012. These additional disposals include refining capacity in the United Kingdom, and marketing positions in Chile and several African countries. This will enhance our competitive performance, and improve our customer and partner focus. </p> \n<p> Shell started commercial production at two new projects during the quarter; the 20 thousand boe/d Schoonebeek Enhanced Oil Recovery project in the Netherlands, and Qatargas 4 LNG, with a capacity of 7.8 million tonnes per year. Together, in an industry that needs sustained investment in diverse energy sources to meet customer demand, these projects are expected to add 90 thousand boe/d of peak production for Shell. These projects are part of a sequence of over 20 new Upstream start-ups planned for 2011-14, as we deliver on our plans for sustainable growth. The first gas flowed from Qatar’s North Field into the new Pearl Gas-to-Liquids project during the quarter, where Shell’s value-added technology is underpinning the development of the world’s largest GTL facility.</p> \n<p> We continue to crystallise new investment options for medium-term growth, including the confirmation of the Geronggong discovery in deep water Brunei, and new LNG potential in the Wheatstone development in Australia, where our gas discoveries have been included in a new partner-operated LNG project, which is under study.” </p> \n<p> Voser concluded: “We are making good progress against our targets, to deliver a more competitive performance.”<br /> </p>",

Our profits have fallen with energy prices, but our growth strategy is delivering to the bottom line.</p> \n<p>Shell’s second quarter 2012 earnings declined from year-ago levels, with weaker oil and North American gas prices offsetting the benefit of increased upstream volumes and improved refining margins. Our profits pay for Shell’s dividends and substantial investments in new projects, to ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies for our customers, adding value for our shareholders.”</p> \n<p>Voser continued: “Our industry continues to see significant energy price volatility as a result of economic and political developments. Shell is implementing a long-term, consistent strategy against this volatile backdrop. Our plans for organic capital investment of around $32 billion in 2012 and medium-term financial and production growth are on track.</p> \n<p>Shell has continuous improvement programmes in place to increase operational uptime and performance and to control costs. The new projects we’ve built in recent years are driving growth in the company today, and our investment decisions should drive oil and gas production for decades to come, with more than 20 key upstream projects under construction today.”</p> \n<p>“We want leadership positions in the plays where we choose to invest, such as deepwater, integrated gas, tight gas and traditional basins, creating value for shareholders with Shell’s investment, people and innovation,” Voser said.</p> \n<p>“Looking further into the future, Shell is following a deliberate strategy to bring more choice into the company’s next tranche of investment decisions, generating a larger range of new investment choices and growth pathways. Capital efficiency is an important part of Shell’s approach, with on-going actions to sell non-core positions, to form strategic partnerships and to add new growth positions.</p> \n<p>Shell has continued to build high potential exploration acreage positions in 2012, including new liquids-rich shale and deepwater plays, and we are drilling important new wells over the next few months. In addition, Shell is assessing new integrated gas options in North America.”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded: “Our strategy is focused on innovation and competitiveness.

The Alternative Reference ADS Price will apply to holders of A ADSs who are not subject to Dutch withholding tax and all holders of B ADSs.</p><h2></h2><table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th> &nbsp; </th> \n   <th> Q2 2011 </th> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> A reference ADS&nbsp;price (US$) </td> \n   <td> 65.775 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Alternative reference ADS price (US$) </td> \n   <td> 65.604 </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table><p>The Reference ADS Price equals (i) the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS plus (ii) the UK stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”), which is chargeable at 1.5 per cent. with respect to each new A ADS. The A Reference ADS Price will also include an amount equal to the Dutch withholding tax rate of 15 per cent. on the SDRT. The Alternative Reference ADS Price will not be adjusted to reflect Dutch withholding tax.</p> \n<br />Scrip dividend programme \n<p>RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme.</p> \n<p>Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends if declared by RDS. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.</p> \n<p>Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A shares issued.</p> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on \n<a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>. \n<br />Royal Dutch Shell plc\n<br />The Hague, August 10, 2011",

We have announced around $6 billion of acquisitions and new acreage and also around $6 billion of asset sales in 2012, which will better position Shell for growth.</p> \n<p>“I am pleased with our progress in a difficult industry environment.

              "maintext": "<p>“Our results have improved considerably compared with year-ago levels, and our profitability has increased from the low levels we saw in the fourth quarter 2009. This has been driven by higher energy prices, operational and production performance and Shell’s growth programmes.</p> \n<p>We are making good progress in improving our near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth and maturing next generation project options. Our results reflected the successful ramp-up of our new upstream projects in Russia and Brazil, supporting a 6% increase in our production volumes and a 38% increase in sales volumes, in our industry-leading LNG business.</p> \n<p>Downstream asset sales programmes are on track, with an exit from New Zealand completed, and further disposals in hand. We are making good progress with plans to reduce costs by $1 billion in 2010, and embedding the culture of continuous improvement, commerciality and cost control in our day-to-day activities.</p> \n<p>We are in a delivery window for new growth. In the Gulf of Mexico, we recently had a successful start-up of the 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) Perdido spar, and we commenced production at the Shell Eastern Petrochemicals project in Singapore. These two start-ups are part of a sequence of 13 new projects that are planned to come on stream in 2010-11 and underpin our growth targets to 2012.</p> \n<p>Looking to new longer-term opportunities, we have been busy in 2010, generating some interesting new positions. Shell’s explorers have made 3 new exploration discoveries in the US Gulf of Mexico, and we have entered into new tight and shale gas acreage in China. In Australia, we have agreed to purchase Arrow Energy Limited, with our partner PetroChina, where we see potential for a 7 to 8 million tonnes per year LNG project, sourced from coal bed methane. In Downstream, we have signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to merge our Brazilian portfolio and selected next generation biofuels technologies with Cosan S.A., which would create a leading Brazilian downstream and biofuels company.</p> \n<p>There are mixed signals for the near-term outlook. So far in 2010, oil prices have remained firm, and demand for petrochemicals has increased, but refining margins, oil products demand and spot gas prices all remain under pressure. Although there are signs of an improving economic outlook, we are not relying on it, we are continuing with our focus on cash flow growth, underpinned by new project start-ups and lower costs.”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded: “I am pleased with the results in the first quarter 2010, which were largely driven by our own actions. The priorities are for a more competitive performance, for growth, and for sharper delivery of strategy. There is more to come from Shell.”<br /> </p>",

If a scrip dividend scheme is introduced, shareholders would be provided with full details of its terms and conditions and how to participate. Any such authority granted by shareholders would last for a period of five years from the date of the Annual General Meeting in accordance with RDS’s Articles of Association.</p> \n<p><br /> <b>Royal Dutch Shell plc<br /> The Hague, April 28, 2010</b></p>",

              "maintext": "<p>“We are delivering on our strategy. Shell’s cost programmes have delivered over $3.5 billion of annualised underlying savings. Our investments have underpinned a 5% increase in oil and gas production for the quarter, a 34% increase in LNG sales volumes, and an 18% increase in chemicals sales volumes. This is a good performance from Shell, despite today’s challenging macro economic conditions. We are on track for growth.</p> \n<p>We are making good progress on delivering performance improvement, a new wave of production growth, and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders.</p> \n<p>The corporate restructuring programme we announced a year ago, called Transition 2009, is now complete. The three new businesses, created in Transition 2009 – Upstream Americas, Upstream International, and Projects &amp; Technology – are a powerful platform for a faster implementation of strategy, clearer accountabilities, and a competitive focus. Transition 2009, restructuring in corporate functions, and our initiatives in Downstream have resulted in annualised underlying cost savings of over $3.5 billion, exceeding the target by around 15% and some 6 months ahead of schedule. Approximately 7,000 employees will leave Shell as a result of these changes, some 18 months earlier than planned.</p> \n<p>We have exceeded the targets we set last year for costs and staff reduction. We are putting new emphasis on “continuous improvement”, which will drive competitive financial and operating performance through the business cycle, and build on Shell’s high safety and environmental standards. Capital efficiency is an important part of our continuous improvement drive. We will exit from non-core positions, both in Upstream and Downstream as we refocus our portfolio on material positions with growth potential. We expect $7-8 billion of asset sales in 2010-11, as we accelerate our disposal plans.</p> \n<p>Shell is in a delivery window for new growth. Gbaran-Ubie, on stream at the end of the second quarter, the 4th of 13 new project start-ups in the 2010-11 timeframe, which underpin Shell’s cash flow and production growth targets for 2012.”</p> \n<p>Turning to longer term opportunities, Voser commented: “We continue to make good progress generating growth options. During the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of substantial new positions in US on-shore gas, with the purchase of East Resources, Inc., which is a leader in the Marcellus shale, and new acreage in the liquids-rich Eagle Ford shale gas play in South Texas.</p> \n<p>We continue to see mixed signals in the global economy. Oil prices have remained firm so far this year, but refining margins, oil products demand and natural gas spot prices all remain under pressure. Our earnings and cashflow have rallied from 2009’s lows, but the outlook remains uncertain.”</p> \n<p>Commenting on the industry situation in the Gulf of Mexico, Voser said: “The BP Macondo blow-out and the related Gulf of Mexico oil spill is a tragedy for everyone affected. We were all shocked by the loss of life there, and the on-going and wide-spread impacts from the spill. World-wide deep water production has an important role to play in the global energy supply equation, with potential for production growth with supply diversity, and sustained investment in technology, jobs and services. The recent announcement of Shell’s participation in a new, $1 billion Gulf of Mexico oil spill containment system, is an example of where we are working with governments and partners to improve the industry’s capabilities. ”</p> \n<p>Voser concluded: “I am pleased with the results in the second quarter 2010. We are putting the priority on a sharper delivery of our strategy, aiming for profitable growth and a more competitive performance from Shell.”<br /> </p>",

              "maintext": "<p>“Our results have rebounded substantially from year-ago levels, driven by some improvement in industry conditions, and Shell’s strategy. We are seeing new growth, with improved earnings and cash flow, underpinned by a 5% increase in oil and gas production, a 22% increase in LNG sales and increased downstream volumes. This is a better performance from Shell, achieved despite continued difficult industry conditions in refining and natural gas markets.</p> \n<p> We are making good progress on implementing our strategy, with a focus on performance improvement, delivering a new wave of growth, and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders, with achievements in all of these themes during the quarter.</p> \n<p> With an emphasis on continuous improvement, Shell is driving down costs and improving capital efficiency. We have achieved some $2 billion of asset sales so far in 2010, and announced the disposal of late-life oil and gas positions at Statfjord in Norway, and refining capacity at Heide in Germany during the quarter. Our cash generation from operations continues to improve. We expect some $7-8 billion of asset sales in the 2010-11 timeframe, including exits from non-core refining and marketing positions in Europe and Africa, and rationalisation of our tight gas portfolio in North America, following recent acquisitions there.” </p> \n<p> Turning to growth delivery, Voser commented: “We are in a delivery window for new growth. Our new oil sands mine – Jackpine – started production during the quarter, part of the 100,000 boe/d Athabasca Oil Sands Project Expansion 1. AOSP-1 is the 5th start-up in a sequence of 13 new projects for 2010-11, which will drive us to achieve our cash flow and production targets for 2012.</p> \n<p> Shell has continued to make progress with longer term growth options during the quarter, with the final investment decision on two new deep water projects – the 100,000 boe/d Mars B development in the Gulf of Mexico, and Phase 2 of the BC-10 development in Brazil. We have signed a purchase agreement with East Resources, Inc., acquiring tight gas acreage in the USA, bringing our total North America gas potential resources to some 40 tcfe, completed the joint acquisition of Arrow Energy Limited, an Australian CBM-LNG play, and progressed our Brazil retail and biofuels joint venture with Cosan.” </p> \n<p> Voser concluded: “We are making good progress against our targets, and there is more to come from Shell.”<br /> </p>",

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on \n<a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>. \n<br />Royal Dutch Shell plc\n<br />The Hague, November 10, 2010",

              "maintext": "<p>“Our 2010 earnings increased substantially from 2009 levels, driven by improving industry fundamentals, and Shell’s production growth and cost performance. Our 2010 oil and natural gas production volumes were 3.3 million boe/d, an increase of 5%. LNG sales volumes increased by 25%, with continued growth in Downstream. Fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings were supported by higher oil prices and chemicals margins. However, our earnings were impacted by weak refining margins, pressure on certain regional natural gas prices, and volatility in Downstream marketing margins as a result of rising oil prices.</p> \n<p> In 2010 Shell made good progress on implementing strategy, improving near-term performance, delivering a new wave of production growth, and maturing the next generation of growth options for shareholders. </p> \n<p> Shell has a strong focus on continuous improvement, reducing costs, enhancing Shell’s operating performance, and rebalancing the portfolio for profitable growth. Underlying costs declined by $2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, bringing the total underlying cost reduction to some $4 billion for 2009 and 2010 combined, a reduction of some 10%. </p> \n<p> Disposals of $7 billion of non-core assets in 2010 bring total asset sales in the last 5 years to some $30 billion. Year-end balance sheet gearing was 17.1%, comfortably within Shell’s 0-30% target range. We have delivered our 2010-11 asset sales targets ahead of schedule. For 2011, asset sales proceeds could reach some $5 billion, including some $2 billion of proceeds from transactions announced in 2010.” </p> \n<p> Turning to growth delivery, Voser commented: “Shell’s industry-leading investment programme is laying down firm foundations for our shareholders and our customers in the future. In 2010 we started up 6 key projects in Upstream and Downstream. In Qatar, in early 2011, we achieved first offshore gas production at the Qatargas 4 LNG facility. Major construction is complete, on schedule, at the Pearl Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) plant, and commissioning for start-up is underway as planned. </p> \n<p> These projects underpin Shell’s targets for an 11% increase from 2009 to 2012 oil and natural gas production, and enhancement of the Downstream portfolio. This growth will drive a 50-80% increase in cashflow from operations from 2009 to 2012, measured at $60-$80 oil prices. These are ambitious targets, but we are on track,” said Voser.</p> \n<p> “Shell has made good progress on generating longer-term growth during 2010. Shell took two final investment decisions in 2010 for deepwater projects, the Mars B project in the Gulf of Mexico, USA and BC-10 Phase 2 project in Brazil. </p> \n<p> Shell made $7 billion of acquisitions, and invested $3 billion in exploration activities in 2010. The acquisition of East Resources takes our resources potential in North America tight gas to some 40 tcfe. In partnership with PetroChina, we purchased Arrow Energy, an Australian coal bed methane and LNG player, and entered into new tight gas and coal bed methane acreage in China. Shell and its partners signed contracts to develop the giant Majnoon and West Qurna fields in Iraq. Shell’s explorers made 8 discoveries in 2010, in particular the Appomatox discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, with more than 250 million boe resources potential. In Downstream, we progressed a marketing and biofuels joint venture with Cosan in Brazil, and a new 2 million tonnes per year petrochemicals project in Qatar.” </p> \n<p> Voser commented: “We continue to invest for medium-term growth to create value for our shareholders. I expect 2011 net capital investment of some $25-27 billion, including a $1.6 billion investment for the Cosan joint venture. Dividend will be $0.42 per share for the fourth quarter 2010 and is expected to be $0.42 per share for the first quarter 2011. In 2010 Shell declared dividends of $10.2 billion, the largest in our sector, underlining our commitment to shareholder returns.” </p> \n<p> Voser concluded: “We are making good progress against our targets, and there is more to come from Shell.”<br /> </p>",

In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be taxed on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch corporate shareholder.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy existing shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends declared by RDS.</p> \n<p>Shareholders who held only B shares and joined the Scrip Dividend Programme at its launch in September 2010 are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares.</p> For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available on \n<a href=\"http://www.shell.com/scrip\" class=\"shell metrics_crossdomain\">www.shell.com/scrip</a>. \n<br />Dividend timetable for the&nbsp;fourth quarter 2010 interim dividend<h2></h2><table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <th> &nbsp; </th> \n   <th> 4th&nbsp;quarter 2010 </th> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Announcement date </th> \n   <td> February 3, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Ex-dividend date </th> \n   <td> February 9, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Record date&nbsp; </th> \n   <td> February 11, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Scrip reference share price announcement date </th> \n   <td> February 16, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Closing of scrip election and currency election <sup><em>(*)</em></sup> </th> \n   <td> February 25, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Pounds sterling and euro equivalents announcement date </th> \n   <td> March 4, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Payment date </th> \n   <td> March 25, 2011 </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table><em>* &nbsp;A different scrip election date may apply to registered and non registered ADS holders. <br />Registered ADS holders can contact The Bank of New York Mellon for the election deadline that applies.
